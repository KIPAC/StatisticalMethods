    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This course covers the foundations of principled inference from data, primarily in the Bayesian framework, organized around applications in astrophysics and cosmology. Topics include probabilistic modeling of data, parameter constraints and model comparison, numerical methods including Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and connections to frequentist and machine learning frameworks. The course is organized around tutorials that provide hands-on experience with real data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class was developed for and is aimed at beginning graduate students in astrophysics and cosmology, and we strongly encourage most first and second year students working in KIPAC to take it when offered (normally every 2 years). However, the course materials are provided here for anyone who might want to learn (see the [recommended prerequisites](notes/overview.ipynb#Prerequisites)). Therefore, the usual syllabus information is split into two parts:\n",
