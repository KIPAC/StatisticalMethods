    "# PHYSICS 366: Statistical Methods in Astrophysics\n",
    "\n",
    "Course notes and resources for Stanford University graduate course Physics 366.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is intended to provide an introduction to modern\n",
    "statistical methodology, and its applications to problems in\n",
    "astrophysics and cosmology, and is aimed at graduate students\n",
    "intending to do research in this area. We\n",
    "strongly encourage most first and second year students working in\n",
    "KIPAC to take the course.  Our goal is to provide a background that\n",
    "will be directly relevant to the kind of problems that typical KIPAC\n",
    "students will encounter in their research.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is that students taking this course will:\n",
    "* develop familiarity in working with various types of astronomical data.\n",
    "* understand the role of modeling in data analysis.\n",
    "* develop facility with various types of inference from data.\n",
    "* be able to critically evaluate and apply commonly used statistical methodologies.\n",
    "* be able to apply advanced statistical reasoning to problems they are likely to encounter in their research.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Content\n",
    "\n",
    "**Start by looking at the [Overview](notes/overview.ipynb) to understand how this course works, and [Getting Started](notes/getting_started.ipynb) to get up and running with Python and Jupyter, if needed.**\n",
    "Enrolled students should also read the [Assignments](notes/assignments.ipynb) page to see what is expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The course content can be browsed here in static HTML format. This is sufficient for the notes, but to do the tutorials you will need to download them in Jupyter notebook format from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/KIPAC/StatisticalMethods/tree/master/tutorials).\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes and tutorials are listed in reasonable order below, but a better way to navigate the course may be through this nifty [dependency graph](dependency_graph.html) (via [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/)).\n",
