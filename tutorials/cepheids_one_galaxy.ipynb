    "## 3. Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The hierarchical nature of this problem has left us with a large number of nuisance parameters, namely a true absolute magnitude for every one of the cepheids. The question now is: how are we going to deal with it?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few possibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling:\n",
    "\n",
    "We could take a brute force approach - just apply one of the general-purpose algorithms we've looked at and hope it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, while it might not be obvious, this problem (a linear model with normal distributions everywhere) is fully conjugate, given the right choice of prior. We could therefore use a conjugate Gibbs sampling code specific to the linear/Gaussian case (it's common enough thay they exist) or a more general code that works out and takes advantage of any conjugate relations, given a model. (You could also work out and code up the conjugacies yourself, if you're into that kind of thing.) These are all still \"brute-force\" in the sense that they are sampling all the nuisance parameters, but we might hope for faster convergence than a more generic algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Direct integration:\n",
    "\n",
    "If some parameters truly are nuisance parameters, in the sense that we don't care what their posteriors are, then we'll ultimately marginalize over them anyway. Rather than sampling the full-dimensional parameter space and then looking only at the marginal distributions we care about, we always have the option of sampling only parameters we care about, and, while evaluating _their_ posterior, doing integrals over the nuisance parameters in some other way. In other words, we should remember that obtaining samples of a parameter is only one method of integrating over it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether it makes sense to go this route depends on the structure of the model (and how sophisticated you care to make your sampler). Somtimes, sampling the nuisance parameters just like the parameters of interest turns out to be the best option. Other times, direct integration is much more efficient. And, of course, \"direct integration\" could take many forms, depending on the integrand: an integral might be analytic, or it might be best accomplished by quadrature or by monte carlo integration. The dimensionality of the integration (in particular, whether it factors into one-dimensional, or at least low-dimensional, integrals) is something to consider."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "So, for this model, try to write down the posterior for $a_i$, $b_i$ and $\\sigma_i$, marginalized over the $M_{ij}$ parameters. If you're persistent, you should find that the integral is analytic, meaning that we can reduce the sampling problem to a computationally efficient posterior distribution over just $a_i$, $b_i$ and $\\sigma_i$, at the expense of having to use our brains.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the subsections below, you'll get to do this 3 different ways! First you'll apply a generic sampler to the brute-force and analytic integration methods. Then we'll walk through using a Gibbs sampling package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside: a common trick to reduce the posterior correlation between the intercept and slope parameters of a line is to reparametrize the model as $a+bx \\rightarrow a' + b(x-x_0)$, where the \"pivot\" $x_0$ is roughly the mean of $x$ in the data. It isn't strictly necessary to do this, but smaller correlations usually mean faster convergence. Of course, it's important to remeber this redefinition when visualizing/interpreting the results! Below, we'll adopt a pivot based on the `logP` of all the galaxies, to make our lives easier when working with the whole sample in the companion tutorial. This won't be the ideal pivot for any individual galaxy, but we'll still get most of the possible benefit of reducing the posterior correlation."

The log-posterior function is also generic, in the sense that it takes as an argument the log-likelihood function it should use. Another difference is that we provide a function called `logpost_vecarg_A` (\"A\" referring to this part of the notebook) that takes a vector of parameters as input, ordered $a$, $b$, $\\sigma$, $M_1$, $M_2$, ..., instead of a dictionary.

We'll use the `LRGS` package, not because it's the best option (it isn't), but because it's written in pure Python. The industry-standard (and far less specialized) alternative goes by the name JAGS, and requires a separate installation (though one can add a Python interface on top of that).\n",

    "Be honest - were you expecting one of the more challenging problems in the final part of the course to be... fitting a line? The least squares method, whose solution is 100% algebraic, has been around for a couple of centuries. Yet by introducing one feature of the model that breaks the assumptions needed for least squares - intrinsic scatter, something that is completely generic in real situations - we find ourselves needing to find creative solutions to computationally complex problems. This is not an excuse for giving up and using least squares! Hopefully this tutorial has, however, convinced you that it's worth thinking about exactly how to implement the Bayesian solution - and that problems that seem computationally unfeasible at first can turn out to be quite tractable with the application of a little brain-elbow grease."
