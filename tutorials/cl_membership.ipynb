    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Galaxies that fall into massive accumulations of dark matter and hot gas (these are, inaccurately, known as \"clusters of galaxies\") rapidly have their gas stripped and cease forming stars. Hence, if one has an optical photometric survey, one way of finding galaxy clusters is to look for... clusters of galaxies that have similar colors (corresponding to red/non-star-forming spectra at some common redshift).\n",
    "\n",
    "The thing is, along any line of sight there are loads of galaxies of different types with different redshifts, so color is not a reliable way of saying that a particular galaxy is in a cluster. Optical photometric cluster finders can only identify sight-lines where there is probably a cluster, and estimate what it's redshift would be. They also provide a \"richness\", loosely defined as the number of intrinsically red galaxies brighter than some threshold the cluster is supposed to contain. But, again, we can't really be sure whether any given galaxy is actually a member or not from photometric data alone. RedMaPPer, the main cluster-finder used by the Dark Energy Survey and (soon) Rubin/LSST, addresses this by assigning a membership probability to each galaxy near an identified cluster; the richness is then the sum of these probabilities, such that it should _statistically_ mean something like the number of bright, red galaxies in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far so good. But this approach is only good to the extent that the membership probabilities are accurate - or, at least, similarly accurate as a function of cluster mass. This is worth checking, which we could do using redshifts measured for a large number of potential cluster members from spectroscopy. The redshifts (strictly speaking, the implied velocities) for cluster members should be distributed in a tight Gaussian distribution centered on the redshift of the bright central galaxy (BCG). We would expect to see a wider distribution of redshifts from galaxies that are not in the cluster, but despite having similar colors to cluster members.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Analogously to the photometric color problem, it's technically possible for a galaxy at a different cosmological redshift to have such a large peculiar velocity that its redshift is consistent with the cluster's, but redshifts can be measured so precisely, and the cluster distribution is so narrow, that this should be rare. The model we'll build below will account for it, in any case.)"

    "\n",
    "The data we'll be working with ultimately come from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Myles et al. have compiled redshifts from Sloan spectroscopy for potential members of RedMaPPer clusters with estimated redshifts of 0.08-0.12 (this is relatively low, but the only sample for which archival spectroscopy would be relatively complete). Various fascinating cuts, which you can read the paper to learn about if you want, have been applied, and the data have been grouped into 6 bins according to the reported richness of the cluster each galaxy is supposed to belong to, with bin 0, 1, ..., 5 corresponding to increasing richness ranges (nominally increasing cluster mass).\n",
    "\n",
    "For each bin, we simply have a list of values: $x_i = \\frac{z_i - z_\\mathrm{BCG}}{1 + z_\\mathrm{BCG}}$. This quantity is directly related to the velocity implied by the galaxy's redshift, assuming it does belong to the cluster. For simplicity, we'll eschew the conversion to velocity units in the tutorial.\n",

    "Some features should stand out here. First, there are clearly trends in the cluster member fraction, $f$, and cluster velocity dispersion, $\\sigma_c$, from low richness (bin 0) to high richness (bin 5). Finding the former was the point of the paper we're following, while the latter had better be the case, given that velocity dispersion is like a dynamical temperature, and should therefore increase with halo mass.\n",

    "In this notebook, you got some experience with a small Gaussian mixture, implementing it with a traditional posterior-evaluation and with conjugate Gibbs sampling. The latter case demonstrated the introduction of latent parameters in a hierarchical setting. Here the Gibbs approach turned out to be more efficient in terms of time per effectively independent sample, but you can imagine that juggling an additional vector of parameters that scales with the size of the data set isn't _always_ the best decision. We'll also note that for models more complex than this (arguably even for this one), we should probably have used JAGS or a similar Gibbs sampling code, rather than implementing the updates ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a slightly unusual case in that the cluster member velocities genuinely should be Gaussian based on physical considerations, while the background component was surprisingly well described by a single additional Gaussian. Perhaps a more common use of GMMs is to marginalize over a potentially complicated distribution which constitutes a \"nuisance\" part of the model. That is, where we don't care about the model being physically interpretable, and just throw enough Gaussians at the problem to reproduce the data. There are interesting problems that arise in so doing, such as deciding how many is \"enough\", and the sampling quirks that follow from the exchangeability of Gaussians in the mixture (i.e. the same posterior probability can be obtained by swapping parameters between components). These aren't reasons to avoid mixture models, but in general we should be careful not to overinterpret the GMM parameters as meaning that there actually _are_ a certain number of distinct components making up a given distribution."
