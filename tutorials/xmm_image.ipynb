    "This notebook introduces one of the real data sets we'll use in this class, namely an image produced from X-ray CCD data. There's a fair bit of domain-specific information here, but it's useful stuff to see if you haven't worked with imaging data before (regardless of wavelength). Do note that there is also quite a bit of corner cutting, however; the problems based on these data are meant to get key statistical concepts across, and not to show you how to do a completely rigorous analysis that accounts for all instrumental and systematic effects."
