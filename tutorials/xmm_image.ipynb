    "# Tutorial: X-ray Image Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In which we introduce a real astronomical data set, namely an image produced from X-ray CCD data. There's a fair bit of domain-specific information here which is not strictly necessary for this class, but it's useful stuff to see if you haven't worked with imaging data before (regardless of wavelength). Do note that we are still glossing over some things, though, since a completely rigorous analysis that accounts for all instrumental and systematic effects would be more involved than we want any tutorials in this class to be. In any case, this notebook is just about looking at the data and describing what's there.\n",

    "Modern X-ray CCDs are technologically similar to the CCDs used in optical astronomy: when a photon hits a pixel, one or more electrons are promoted into the conduction band and trapped there until being read out. The main practical difference is that X-ray photons are rarer and their energies much higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that:\n",
    "* Only for exceptionally bright sources will we ever have $>1$ photon hit a given pixel in an integration, if we read out the CCD every few seconds.\n",
    "* We do not get 1 electron promoted per photon, as is the case in visible wavelength CCDs. Instead, the number of electrons is roughly proportional to the photon's energy, which means that these imaging devices are actually imaging spectrometers. For simplicity, we won't be taking advantage of that, other than to limit the energy range of photons in the image we look at.\n",
    "* When we say \"counts\" in this context, we mean \"pixel activation events\" rather than number of electrons trapped, so that (as in optical astronomy) we're referring to the number of photons detected (or other events that look like photons to the detector)."

    "As we've seen above, the image is encoded in a standard `numpy` array. But, recalling the aside, we need to be careful about indexing the array. Specifically, we need to remember that the first array index corresponds to $y$ (the vertical direction in the image), and the second index corresponds to $x$ (horizontal). Alternatively, we could create arrays that hold the $x$ and $y$ indices corresponding to each pixel. (Note that we will be using the word \"pixel\" to refer to an entry in the image/exposure map arrays, not a physical pixel in the camera.) This is a little wasteful in terms of computer memory, but allows us to do calculations involving the positions of and distances between points in the image without constantly relying on our human memories to recall something counterintuitive.\n",
