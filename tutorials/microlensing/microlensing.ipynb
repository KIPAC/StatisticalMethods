    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll be looking at data from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE), which monitors stars in our galaxy in the hopes of detecting gravitational microlensing events that occur when a compact mass (e.g. a fainter star) passes in front of the monitored star. Data are available through the [OGLE Early Warning System](http://ogle.astrouw.edu.pl/ogle4/ews/ews.html), which can be fun to browse through.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use this exercise as an excuse to work through calculation of the evidence using nested sampling, with the idea that we will use it for detection - that is, we will compare a model where there is a microlensing event with one where there is not. This is a little hacky, since the lightcurves available have _already_ been selected to contain lensing events (using a different method), but we'll do it anyway. This is also a case where everyone will be using real rather than simulated data, with all of the interesting features that sometimes implies.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will\n",
    "* perform a standard MCMC fit of a microlensing model, as a baseline;\n",
    "* use nested sampling to find constraints on the model parameters and compute the evidence;\n",
    "* perform nested sampling on a lensing-free (i.e. constant) model, and compare the posterior probability of the two models."

That is, the sampling distribution would need to have heavy tails or be a mixture model of some kind, and we would learn something about how common and how extreme the outliers are. The downside to this is that we might spend a lot of time doing model comparison to come up with something that fits the data, and if we don't have many outliers than we probably won't learn very much about them. We'll have just gone to great effort to remove the influence of a few points that we could probably have identified and deleted by eye unamiguously enough.\n",
