    "# Tutorial: X-ray Image Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In which we introduce a real astronomical data set, namely an image produced from X-ray CCD data. There's a fair bit of domain-specific information here which is not strictly necessary for this class, but it's useful stuff to see if you haven't worked with imaging data before (regardless of wavelength). Do note that we are still glossing over some things, though, since a more rigorous analysis that accounts for all instrumental and systematic effects would be more involved than we want any tutorials in this class to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the statistical analysis, we will be sticking with things you've done before, just practicing in a more realistic context where we might want to use a few tricks to speed up our calculations. We will make a few pointed suggestions along those lines, including the use of `numba`, which you don't **have** to take... but this is a problem where taking 20% off the run time is noticeable. Unlike previous notebooks, we won't prescribe a specific algorithm or package for you to use. Exactly how to carry out the fits is up to you, although you are expected to follow best practices (testing convergence, etc.). This is not a terribly difficult inference, but - warning!- it can be tricky to get chains to sample efficiently. Good practice for situations that are not quite as nice as our pedagogical examples from earlier. It will probably take longer than typical to run (possibly quite a bit longer).\n",

    "* fit a simple/symmetric model for the spatial distribution of emission from the gas in a cluster of galaxies, plus an instrumental background;\n",
    "* fit a second model that includes a dense core of bright gas at the cluster center;\n",
    "* compare the two for your own data, and (in conjunction with classmates) see how this varies among clusters."

    "Modern X-ray CCDs are technologically similar to the CCDs used in optical astronomy: when a photon hits a pixel, one or more electrons are promoted into the conduction band and trapped there until being read out. The main practical difference is that X-ray photons are rarer and their energies much higher.\n",

    "* When we say \"counts\" in this context, we mean \"pixel activation events\" rather than number of electrons trapped, so that (as in optical astronomy) we're referring to the number of photons detected (or other events that look like photons to the detector)."

In particular, the spectral information has been thrown away, apart from limiting the counts in our image to a particular energy band (0.6-2.0 keV in this case). The images have also been binned by a factor of 4 to reduce the computational overhead (i.e. the number of image pixels) for this notebook. The original data are from the [Chandra X-ray Observatory](https://cxc.harvard.edu/), and have been cleaned, filtered, and had other things done to them that are beyond the scope of this problem.\n",

This is exactly what we need to transform a model of the sky in $\\mathrm{counts}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{pixel}^{-1}$ into a prediction for the expected number of counts in each image pixel. (The model defined this way is in terms of _surface brightness_, i.e. counts or energy per unit area, time, and solid angle.)

Recall that (other than the places where there isn't an actual CCD), these are largely due to bad columns or damaged detector pixels. Rather than perfectly trust these lowered exposure values, it's safer to entirely mask these. Below, define an `exp_mask` that works like the `region_mask` (i.e. Boolean type, and `True` in the pixels you want to mask) that masks pixels where the exposure map is less than half of its maximum value. Note that you do not need to invoke the `regions` package to do this; it's just a function of the exposure map array that we already have."

There is a necessary downside, which is that `numba` must be able to identify the data type of every variable that's used in the function the first time it's executed (this is when the compilation happens, \"Just In Time\"), and those variables must have _the same_ data type in all future calls to the function.[$^2$](#Note-2) The upshot is that we end up writing code that is a little more barebones and less easily generalizable, e.g. avoiding the use of object oriented methods that `numba` isn't sophisticated enough to decipher, at least in `njit` functions.\n",

The important thing is that, finally, we have a way to compare the data and model straightforwardly.

This doesn't mean you necessarily have to use an MCMC method, but if you use some other method you must be able to extract results in the above format (even if it means artificially breaking samples into multiple \"chains\"). There will be cells below for plotting traces, and tests for convergence and a minimum number of effectively independent samples, that will assume this format, and that must be passed. Parameters should be ordered as in `paramnames`.\n",

    "* If/when writing a function to evaluate the log-posterior (and/or log-prior, log-likelihood), use the `@njit` decorator to squeeze some extra efficiency out of it. It's probably worth it here, and it's definitely worth learning how to use `numba`.\n",
    "* `njit` aside, using a `scipy` distribution's `logpdf` method is (in this case) noticeably slower than directly coding the log PDF, especially if you leave out normalizing terms that don't depend on the model parameters.\n",
    "* The normalization and core radius parameters of the cluster model are strongly degenerate (this is well known among the clusteratti, and is related to preserving the total flux of the model; you might even have noticed it when refining your guess above). It's extremely common for the normalization to be parametrized by the log of $S_0$ rather than $S_0$ directly to reduce the degeneracy. (Don't forget that priors are not generally invariant under reparametrization.)\n",
    "* Depending on what method you employ, it may be a good idea to find the posterior maximum before launching chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note: the solutions are intentionally minimal and vague, since it's no fun if you all decide to just solve things exactly the way we did. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't add various checks of your work, even if you don't see them there. Anyway, here are a bunch of cells for your solution (you don't have to use all of them)."
