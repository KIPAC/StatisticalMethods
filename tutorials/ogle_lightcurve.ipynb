In the 2015 edition, the relevant section for Galactic microlensing is 2.5 (page 77), and the equations defining the microlensing model lightcurve are 2.92 and 2.93. You don't actually need to read all this, but it can be nice to get some intuition about what's underneath the data.\n",

With that substitution, the model parameters are $I_0$, $p$, $t_\\mathrm{max}$ and $t_\\mathrm{E}$.\n",
