    "Here we'll compare different conventions for defining \"best values\" and credible intervals (CI's) to summarize posterior PDFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will\n",
    "* compare conventions that report the posterior mode and highest density region; median and quantiles of the posterior; and mean and standard deviation of the posterior (the latter being **highly discouraged**)\n",
    "* compute the above from samples from a PDF rather than from an analytic function, since in the future samples are usually the only characterization of the posterior that we will have\n",
    "* use these methods to produce credible _intervals_ (CI's) for a single parameter, and credible _regions_ (CR's) for 2 parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, the internal calculations involved in doing these things are not difficult, but we also don't think they're terribly illuminating. On the other hand, you'll need to know how to produce CI's and CR's to summarize the results of pretty much every inference from now on. The upshot is that this tutorial resembles a walkthrough of particular software much more than most."

    "### Alternative packages\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other packages that can be better for getting a quick look at plots like those above, in particular `pygtc` and `corner`. We'll use these in later tutorials. They have the advantage that you get the whole triangle plot from a single function call. The downside is that all the calculations are redone each time you call the function, and it isn't so straightforward to do the sanity checks mentioned above. So we recommend using one of those packages only for quickly visualizing samples from a PDF. In contrast, with `incredible` it's straightforward to do the hard calculations once, and then tweak the display to your heart's content, so it might be more suitable for publication graphics (in addition to providing the CI calculations). To summarize the options as of this writing:\n",
    "* `pygtc`: looks nicer than `corner`; can put multiple posteriors on the same plot\n",
    "* `corner`: arguably a little easier to use than `pygtc`, but uglier; downgraded because the default 2D probability levels shown are not the conventional ones\n",
    "* `incredible`: provides fine-tuned control over CR calculations, and ability to save results rather than just a plot, but needs some hand holding\n",
    "* `arviz`: a relatively new addition that looks like it may become the one-stop-shop for CRs and MCMC diagnostics eventually. Steeper learning curve, but worth a look\n",
