It's also a good idea to look at the solution if you suspect a given cell will take a while to run - in these cases we put a `%%time` command in the code, and the solution will show how long that cell took on the instructor's 10 year old laptop.

We're pretty sure that adding new code cells in places where you are asked to complete things is ok. It goes without saying that deliberate attempts to circumvent these checks will be considered cheating and dealt with under the applicable University policies.\n",

The hope is that all of these code checks will catch many or most mistakes that might be made, ideally with that feedback being immediate, but they aren't sophisticated enough on their own to say whether everything has been done correctly. The purpose of the automatic code-checking framework is not to replace human grading, but to make it possible for the human grader to focus more on the substance of the work than on debugging."

So in this class we will not really use parallelization, but you should know that it's there, often easily, for your own work.
