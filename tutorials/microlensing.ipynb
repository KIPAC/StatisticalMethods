We mention those two options because they (among others) been used by previous students, but you can choose something else out of the [list in the notes](../notes/MC_packages.ipynb), or indeed from elsewhere if you know of another option. Please don't use nested sampling, however, as you'll get to play with that anyway in the [Model Comparison](model_selection.ipynb) tutorial. If in doubt, drop us a line and ask.\n",
