    "## Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is mostly to practice going from a real-world(ish) problem described in words to an actionable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be explicit, by model, we mean\n",
    "1. a list of quantities comprising your data and parameters from which predicted data can be produced;\n",
    "2. a PGM representing the conditional dependences of the parameters and data;\n",
    "3. a list of expressions containing the same information as the PGM, with the added specification of what probability distributions are involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Expressions\" in this context are of the form you saw in the reading, and need not be fully spelled-out equations, for example:\n",
    "* $a \\Leftarrow b,c$ \n",
    "* $x \\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(\\mu, \\sigma)$\n",
    "* $\\mu \\sim \\mathrm{some~prior}$\n",
    "\n",
    "translates to\n",
    "* $a$ is a deterministic function of $b$ and $c$\n",
    "* $x$ is normally distributed with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$\n",
    "* $\\mu$ is distributed according to some prior that I would need to specify in practice, but don't necessarily have to bother with for this exercise. Here \"prior\" implies no dependence on other listed parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Every_ parameter and datum in the model must have such a rule for how it depends on other quantities (or priors). The result is a recipe for generating mock data, and also contains all the information needed to do inference given real data that we've collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no set rule saying that it's better to draw the PGM first and write the expressions second, or vice versa; different people find each approach more or less natural.\n",
    "\n",
    "To turn in a PGM, you could for e.g.\n",
    "* draw on paper and include a photo in the notebook\n",
    "* do the digital equivalent with a tablet and stylus\n",
    "* use some other simple drawing tool and include that graphic in the notebook\n",
    "* use the `daft` package to produce a PGM graphic directly in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Personally, I find the current version of `daft` extremely ugly and have taken to using Google Drawings or old-fashioned scribbling, but whatever works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, note that **some of the situations described below are intentionally ambiguous**. Expect to have to make some assumptions in order to fully specify the model, and note what they are."

You can assume that the total number of clusters, 361, is given by fiat and doesn't need to be generated by the model.

Some kind of model, parametrized by $\\theta$, describes the time series of the resulting flux. Before we get to measure a number of counts, however, each image is affected by time-specific variables, e.g. related to changing weather. To account for these, you've also measured 10 other stars in the same field in every exposure (you can assume that the weather affects everything in the same image equally). The assumption is that the average intrinsic flux of these stars should be constant in time, so that they can be used to correct for photometric variations, putting the multiple measurements of the target star on the same scale.\n",
