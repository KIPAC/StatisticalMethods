    "In the grid solution, we used uniform priors for $x_0$ and $y_0$ _confined to the image_. This is not something that a Gaussian distribution can reproduce. On the other hand, we know from that analysis (and could reasonably suspect in this case) that $x_0$ and $y_0$ will be constrained well enough that they will not be consistent with the image edges, in which case the functional difference between a uniform prior over the image and an improper uniform prior over the whole $x_0$-$y_0$ plane is minimal. Let's therefore adopt the improper uniform prior, which corresponds to the limit $s_x,s_y\\rightarrow\\infty$ (at which point the values of $m_x$ and $m_y$ cease to be important). However, as before, you should write your code such that any valid hyperparameters can be used. Here we add them to the `hyperparameters` dictionary:"
