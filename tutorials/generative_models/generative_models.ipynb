    "This exercise is mostly to practice going from a real-world(ish) problem described in words to an actionable model. It will also get you working a little with `scipy.stats`, if it's unfamiliar.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be explicit, by model, we mean\n",
    "1. a list of quantities comprising your data and parameters from which predicted data can be produced;\n",
    "2. a PGM representing the conditional dependences of the parameters and data;\n",
    "3. a list of expressions containing the same information as the PGM, with the added specification of what probability distributions are involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Expressions\" in this context are of the form you saw in the reading, and need not be fully spelled-out equations, for example:\n",
    "* $a \\Leftarrow b,c$\n",
    "* $x \\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(\\mu, \\sigma)$\n",
    "* $\\mu \\sim \\mathrm{Uniform}(0, 10)$\n",
    "\n",
    "translates to\n",
    "* $a$ is a deterministic function of $b$ and $c$,\n",
    "* $x$ is normally distributed with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$,\n",
    "* $\\mu$ is uniformly distributed between 0 and 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Every_ parameter and datum in the model must have such a rule for how it depends on other quantities. The result is a recipe for generating mock data, and also contains all the information needed to do inference given real data that we've collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no set rule saying that it's better to draw the PGM first and write the expressions second, or vice versa; different people find each approach more or less natural.\n",
    "\n",
    "I strongly suggest inserting PGMs into your copy of the notebook for ease of reference, although it isn't strictly required. You can either make them digitally to begin with or draw them (neatly) on paper and take a photo. These days, I use Google Drawings or Keynote."

You can assume that the total number of clusters, $N$, is given by fiat and doesn't need to be generated by the model.

    "Next we'll through the process of generating mock data from the model. But first...\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aside: using `scipy.stats`\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with standard probability distributions (that is, those that have names like \"Poisson\"), `scipy.stats` (imported as `st` above) is often the best option. Code you write yourself for a specific calculation can sometimes be faster, but tends to be less clear and flexible, so we recommend using the built-in `scipy.stats` functionality unless speed is absolutely essential. Here is a very brief introduction, which you should supplement be reading the documentation as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each built-in distribution has its own list of \"shape\" parameters, which you can find out from its docstring, e.g. `st.poisson?` reveals that the Poisson distribution has one \"shape\" parameter, which is the mean. In the `scipy` implementation, _every_ distribution also has `loc` and `scale` parameters, which are needlessly confusing and usually meaningless. But, for example, the normal distribution (`st.norm`) doesn't have \"shape\" parameters for its mean and standard deviation; instead the mean is `loc` and the standard deviation is `scale`. For the most part this isn't an issue, but it does mean that you should take care to check the definition of the \"shape\" parameters and the intended meaning of `loc` and `scale` before using a distribution for the first time. (For example, the two parameter arguments to `st.uniform` are not the lower and upper limits of a uniform distribution, as any sensible person would assume.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time, one should directly call functions associated with each distribution, as in\n",
    "* `st.norm.pdf(0.5, 3.14, 2.72)` - evaluate the PDF of a normal distrbution with mean of 3.14 and standard deviation of 2.72 at $x=0.5$;\n",
    "* `st.poisson.cdf(3, 5.0)` - evaluate the CDF of a Poisson distribution with mean 5.0 at $x=3$;\n",
    "* `st.uniform.rvs(10.0, 90.0)` - generate 1 random draw from a uniform distribution between 10 and 100 (yes, really 100). Add the `size=` keyword argument to generate more than one at a time, returned as an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "If (and only if) we are going to be making many calls to a distribution without changing the values of its parameters, it can make sense to store a \"frozen\" (that is, with fixed parameter values) distribution object. Depending on the distribution, this might gain us some efficiency, or it might simply be a convenience. For example,\n",
    "```\n",
