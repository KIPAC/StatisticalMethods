    "# Tutorial: Cepheid Period-Luminosity Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Cepheids are stars whose brightness oscillates with a stable period, the logarithm of which appears to be strongly correlated with their mean absolute magnitude. Traditionally, these stars form part of the \"distance ladder\" establishing the relationship between cosmological redshift and distance, i.e. the Hubble expansion rate. The absolute luminosity for a given period is measured in our Galaxy, or one very nearby, where the distance can be determined by geometric paralax; measured fluxes and periods can then be used to estimate the distance to larger numbers of more distant galaxies where other distance proxies such as supernova luminosities are calibrated. This procedure requires the period-luminosity relation to be universal (the same relation must hold in every galaxy).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using this data set to explore some aspects of hierarchical models, which are a natural way to handle data for populations of sources. In this notebook, we'll get familiar with a particular data set (from [Riess et al. 2011](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...730..119R/abstract)), and think about what kind of model might be appropriate."

    "It's standard to fit a linear relation between absolute magnitude and log-period, which translates to a power-law between luminosity and period. That looks broadly reasonable, based on the plots above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, we'll be interested in whether the period-luminosity relations of the different galaxies are indeed universal, meaning that exactly the same relationship holds for ech galaxy. So, let's consider that the parameters of those relations may not be identical:\n",
    "\n",
    "$M = a_i + b_i \\log_{10}P$, with $i$ indexing the host galaxies.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we wouldn't expect the intercepts and slopes for different galaxies to be entirely unrelated to one another either. This is one aspect that makes the problem hierarchical - there are properties of each galaxy ($a_i$ and $b_i$) that we believe should follow some parent distribution, even if they aren't identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, at a lower level, we've assumed that the Cepheids within each host follow the scaling relation above. However, we should allow for the possibility that they don't follow the relation exactly; there may be some intrinsic scatter that makes the true magnitudes deviate from the linear relation above, even without accounting for measurement errors. This is another level of the hierarchy - there is a property of every Cepheid in a given host ($M$) that follows a parent distribution specific to that host (some to-be-specified scatter distribution about the linear relation above).\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the measured quantities, for the apparent magnitudes we are given estimates and error bars (as is common). With nothing else to go on, we'd normally assume these are Gaussian uncertainties, and normally this should be accurate enough for background-subtracted fluxes measured from many photons. We are given no information about uncertainty in the periods, so we'll have to assume those are precise. (If they aren't, this might contribute to any intrinsic catter we see.) Similarly, we'll take the redshifts to be precise, as measuring them to high accuracy and precision should be straightforward for such nearby galaxies. The fact that the galaxies are so nearby also means that we don't really need to worry about modeling uncertainties in the conversion from absolute to apparent magnitudes (the linear apparoximation of $d_\\mathrm{L}$ above).\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize our model:\n",
    "* We have precise periods and Gaussian distributed apparent magnitudes for a number of Cepheids in different galaxies.\n",
    "* Each galaxy's redshift is given precisely, allowing us to compute a distance and convert between apparent and absolute magnitude with negligible uncertainty.\n",
    "* Within a given galaxy, Cepheid magnitudes and log-periods are assumed to follow an overall linear trend, with some intrinsic scatter.\n",
    "* The parameters of the line and scatter may not be identical from galaxy to galaxy, but we'll assume they are drawn from some to-be-specified parent distributions.\n",
