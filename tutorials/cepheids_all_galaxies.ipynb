    "\n",
    "Before charging forward, let's finish specifying the model. We previously said we would allow an intrinsic scatter about the overall period-luminosity relation - let's take that to be Gaussian such that the linear relation sets the mean of the scatter distribution, and there is an additional parameter for the width (in magnitudes), $\\sigma_i$, for the $i$th galaxy. (Note that normal scatter in magnitudes, which are log-luminosity, could also be called log-normal scatter in luminosity; these are completely equivalent.)\n",

    "Unlike the [single-galaxy tutorial](cepheids_one_galaxy.ipynb), here we will _not_ assume wide, uniform priors on the period-luminosity relation parameters, $a_i$, $b_i$ and $\\sigma_i$, for each galaxy. Instead, let's add a level of hierarchy to the model by assuming that the values of $a$ for each galaxy come from a normal distribution with mean $\\mu_a$ and standard deviation $\\tau_a$, and similarly $b$ and $\\sigma$ come from their own normal distributions. In the case of $\\sigma$, the parent distribution must be truncated at 0, by definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we will not consider the possibility that, for example, all 3 come from a joint, multivariate normal distribution with possible correlations between them, although that could easily be justified. In practice, fitting for independent distributions for each parameter is a reasonable first step. This first attempt at answering the question of whether each period-luminosity parameter is universal thus boils down to constraining the hierarchical model, and determining whether each of the $\\tau$ parameters is consistent with zero - if so, the corresponding parameter is consistent with having the same value for all galaxies in the sample. We will adopt wide, uniform priors on the new hyperparameters of the model ($\\mu$s and $\\tau$s), to make life easier.\n",

    "\n",
    "If some parameters truly are nuisance parameters, in the sense that we don't care what their posteriors are, then we'll ultimately marginalize over them anyway. Rather than sampling the full-dimensional parameter space and then looking only at the marginal distributions we care about, we always have the option of sampling only parameters we care about, and, while evaluating _their_ posterior, doing integrals over the nuisance parameters in some other way. In other words, we should remember that obtaining samples of a parameter is only one method of integrating over it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether it makes sense to go this route depends on the structure of the model (and how sophisticated you care to make your sampler). Somtimes, sampling the nuisance parameters just like the parameters of interest turns out to be the best option. Other times, direct integration is much more efficient. And, of course, \"direct integration\" could take many forms, depending on the integrand: an integral might be analytic, or it might be best accomplished by quadrature or by monte carlo integration. The dimensionality of the integration (in particular, whether it factors into one-dimensional, or at least low-dimensional, integrals) is something to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, it's relatively straightforward to analytically marginalize over the numerous $M_{ij}$ parameters. That would leave us with only 3 parameters left to sample per galaxy, plus the 6 $\\mu$s and $\\tau$s, for a total of $3N_\\mathrm{gal}+6=33$ parameters. Brute force sampling of these remaining 33 parameters is not unthinkable, although in practice it may or may not be a headache.\n",

Using results given in the [gaussians](gaussians.ipynb) tutorial, the corresponding integrals can be made analytic, greatly simplifying our lives. You should be left with a product of something simple (on paper), over cepheids $j$ in galaxy $i$."

    "Another option is to make use of the samples from individual-galaxy fits that we showed in Section 2. These are samples of the posterior, for each galaxy, when the priors on the scaling parameters are very wide and uniform, i.e. constant over the domain where the likelihood is significantly non-zero. They are, therefore, also samples from a PDF that is proportional to the likelihood function for the corresponding galaxy. To see why that might be helpful, consider the posterior for the hyperparameters of the new model, $\\vec{\\alpha} = (\\mu_a,\\tau_a,\\mu_b,\\tau_b,\\mu_\\sigma,\\tau_\\sigma)$, marginalized over all the pesky $a_i$, $b_i$ and $\\sigma_i$ parameters:\n",

(Had we used a non-uniform prior before, we could do something similar, but would need to divide by that prior density in the sum above.) In effect, the product above and everything in it becomes an importance weight for the prior over $\\alpha$ that directly allows us to approximate the posterior of those parameters.\n",
    "\n",

This approximation may or may not be a significant concession on our parts; here it's clearly a bit sketchy in the case of $\\sigma$, which has a hard cut at $\\sigma=0$ that at least one individual galaxy is consistent with. But, with this approximation, the integral in $p(\\vec{\\alpha}|\\mathrm{data})$, above, could be done analytically, much as we simplified the single-galaxy likelihood.\n",

Since the normal distribution has nice conjugacies, we could consider a scheme where we sample $\\mu_a|\\tau_a,\\{a_i\\}$, then $\\tau_a|\\mu_a,\\{a_i\\}$, then similarly for $\\mu_b$, $\\tau_b$, $\\mu_\\sigma$ and $\\tau_\\sigma$, and _then_ all the individual $a_i$, $b_i$, $\\sigma_i$ and $M_{ij}$ parameters as we did with LRGS in the [single-galaxy tutorial](cepheids_one_galaxy.ipynb) (accounting for the normal \"prior\" on $a_i$ given by $\\mu_a$ and $\\tau_a$, etc.). Or we could conjugate-Gibbs sample the $\\mu$'s and $\\tau$'s, while using some other method entirely for the galaxy-specific parameters.

In brief, when the intrinsic scatter for some quantity is consistent with zero, the sampler may pick up on the effective scatter which is present because we have only discrete samples as we integrate. In other words, there's a lower limit to how well values of $a$ (for example) for the different galaxies can agree in practice, but this lower limit is an artifact of the discrete sampling. This scatter can in principle provide a very strong, unwanted signal, resulting in a sharp peak in the posterior samples at small values of $\\tau_a$. Yet, this spike would be spurious, as it wouldn't exist if we were doing the integrations in some another way that allowed multiple galaxies to have exactly the same value of $a$.
