    "\n",
    "It is possible to solve **all** of the analytic stuff in this notebook without once carrying out an integral by hand, and you are strongly encouraged to do so. The key is to use the properties of PDFs. When we work with probability densities, we are in a tiny and specialized corner of the space of all calculus, and there are **loads** of shortcuts. Of note here:\n",
    "* **Any** PDF is by definition normalized, whether marginal, conditional or other. If we can represent it with a lower-case $p$, the indefinite integral over its support is 1. Use this.\n",
    "* When manipulating expressions for PDFs, it's often enough to focus on their functional dependence on random variables. Normalizing coefficients (that don't depend on random variables) can be put out of your mind. Why? Because, again, PDFs must be normalized, and will be automatically as long as we don't accidentally break any rules of probability calculus. Say I'm manipulating a PDF, $p(x)$, and find that it can be written as $e^{-x}x^a\\times(\\mathrm{ugly~combination~of~constants})$. The $x$ dependence of this is the same as the Poisson PDF, so (ipso facto!) $p(x)$ must be Poisson. Not only that, but the ugly coefficient must simplify to $a!$ such that $p(x)$ is normalized, and we don't even need to bother working through it!\n",
    "\n",
    "These are REALLY helpful shortcuts to get comfortable with.\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide a little more motivation, the solutions in part 1 can be written down essentially immediately using the properties of PDFs covered in the notes. With a little algebraic manipulation, the joint PDF in part 2 can be rearranged into something recognizable as either a product $p(x)p(y|x)$ or $p(y)p(x|y)$, depending how you group terms. There is no need to do any actual calculus here."

In brief, in an argument list this is shorthand for any number of keyword arguments the user might pass. If we called `unc_p_x_given_y(1, 2, mx=3)` later on, then within the `unc_p_x_given_y` function scope we would have access to a dictionary called `kwargs` which would be `{'mx':3}`. We can (and will) also make calls like `unc_p_x(1, **unc)`; this is executed as if it were `unc_p_x(1, mx=1.0, my=2.3, sx=1.0, sy=0.5)` (see the definition of `unc` above). You're obviously **not required** to use this syntax in your own code, but it's convenient enough that you'll be seeing a lot of it in these notebooks. (Incidentally, the fact that we used `**kwargs` in some of the prototypes below is a pretty heavy hint, once you're fluent with the syntax.)"
