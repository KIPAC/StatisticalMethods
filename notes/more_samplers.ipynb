    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm has historically been _the_ workhorse MCMC method, in that it is widely applicable, its inner workings and shortcomings are relatively simple to understand, and it's straightforward to assess how well it's working. But that doesn't mean it's the only or best solution for any particular problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would caution against thinking of the methods below as more \"advanced\", in the sense of being automatically preferable, compared with those we have already seen. For example, several of them are \"better\" in the sense that the sequences they produce tend to be less correlated than Metropolis would yield. Yet, we've seen that correlated chains are not a bug, as such. In practice, what we care about is accumulating a certain number of effectively independent samples in a reasonable amount of human time, with the run time determined by the number of times the posterior needs to be evaluated. An algorithm that produces completely independent samples, but requires 10 posterior evaluations for each one, is no better according to this metric than a Metropolis kernel with a correlation length of 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of which is to say that, in my limited experience, this is one of those cases where there just isn't a free lunch to be had. Compared to Metropolis with the most straightforward and common-sense proposal adaptation (see below), other methods that I've tried (which, admittedly, does not include everything below) haven't been any faster. Since many of those methods don't admit the same simple [diagnostics that we saw previously](mcmc_diagnostics.ipynb), I tend to stubbornly stick with Metropolis (or conjugate Gibbs, when possible) in my own work. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't learn about and try other things. And there are certain tasks that MCMC methods simply don't do well, like calculation of the Bayesian evidence, for which we'll want to use other approaches (see [Model Evaluation and Comparison II](model_evaluation.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to keep in mind, when faced with a very computationally expensive problem, is that we're allowed to use different samplers for different subsets of parameters, just as long as every parameter gets updated somehow."

    "## Accelerating Metropolis\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first method is not actually a novel one, just our old friend Metropolis with extra bells and whistles. Recall the basic algorithm:\n",
    "```\n",
    "choose a starting point and a proposal scale\n",
    "while we want more samples\n",
    "    propose a new point from a scaled distribution, centered on our current position\n",
    "    accept/reject the new point\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To speed things up in human time, we can also take advantage of the _embarrassingly parallel_ nature of the algorithm. That is, nothing prevents us from running multiple, independent chains using as many CPUs as we have available, and pooling the chains at the end. In fact, we've seen that we'll want multiple chains in any case, to test for convergence. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the algorithm itself, we mainly have freedom to play with the proposal distribution. We've already discussed using a proposal distribution that discourages _very_ small steps (in scaled units).  What else can we do? The better we can tune the proposal distribution to match the overall shape of the posterior, the more efficiently the chain will be able to move around in parameter space. Hence, the goal is to cleverly and automatically tune the proposal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strictly speaking, tuning the proposal distribution on the fly breaks the rules of MCMC (specifically, detailed balance). Technically, we should stop tuning after some time, once things appear to be working well, and throw away all steps before that point. In practice, if we've actually managed to converge to the target distribution, subsequent updates to the proposal distribution will be negligible anyway, making this less of a concern."

    "### Adapting the proposal distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of making the proposal distribution more efficient would be to customize the proposal scale for each parameter. If we believe the chain has begun (laboriously) to sample from the posterior, we could periodically compute the standard deviation of the samples so far in each direction, and use that as a guess of the appropriate proposal scale. More generally, we could look at the multidimensional covariance of the samples so far, and adjust the shape of our proposal distribution to match; this would let us learn about and compensate for parameter degeneracies. This change is equivalent to using a rotated coordinate basis, with appropriate scales in each new basis direction, for our proposal distribution. We could visualize it like this:\n",

    "In each panel, the ellipse shows the shape of the posterior distribution, and the vectors show the coordinate basis with respect to which the proposal distribution is defined. (We are not confined to proposing along these directions, but are imagining that we want the proposal distribution to be simple with respect to this basis, and have a proposal scale associated with each basis direction.) On the left, the basis is Cartesian, with the scales set to the standard deviation of the (marginal) posterior in each direction; we can see that this results in proposals that are too large on average to be accepted often. In the center, we have rotated the basis for proposals to align with the major and minor axes of the iso-probability surfaces, and tuned the associated scales appropriately. This can equivalently be accomplished by re-defining the parameters to reduce the correlation of the PDF, as illustrated on the right. (Note that, being a rotation and scaling, this parameter transformation is _linear_, meaning that the priors are invariant under it. If we had used a _nonlinear_ reparametrization, we'd need to worry about transforming the prior density accordingly.) For a nice, elliptical PDF like the one shown, a basis that diagonalizes the covariance matrix is optimal."

    "If changes to some parameters require much more costly calculations than others, straightforward diagonalization of the covariance may not be optimal in practice. In this case, we might want to propose changes to fast parameters more often than slow parameters. More generally, given a hierarchy of speeds, we can also *triangularize* the proposal basis, such that the fastest parameter appears in every basis vector, the second-fastest appears in all but one, etc., with the slowest parameter being changed only in tandem with all other parameters. This is illustrated in the right panel, below. We might also consider sampling in faster directions more often than in slower directions.\n",

    "### Communicating parallel chains\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already discussed running independent chains in parallel, and using information gathered so far in a chain to adapt the proposal distribution. Combining these ideas turns out to be extremely powerful. If we start multiple chains in different parts of parameter space as usual, and their proposal distributions are not great out of the box, then chances are they will make their way to different parts of the region where the posterior is non-tiny and then struggle to move around. Pooling the information about where multiple chains are sampling can thus tell us much more about the global shape of the posterior than looking only at one chain. With some imagination, we can see this in the example below, where the most degenerate direction becomes evident within the first few steps of each chain.\n",

Strictly speaking, we should use a procedure like this strictly to find a good proposal distribution, then throw away those chains and run new ones with the proposal distribution fixed. On the other hand, the argument that the proposal distribution will eventually stop changing still holds (normally), so comparisons of the post-convergence chains are still arguably reasonable. In addition, we still have the sanity check that chains with dispersed starting points found their way to the same part of parameter space, regardless of the adaptation method."

    "Consider the function $[p(x)]^{1/T}$, where $p(x)$ is the target PDF. We say a chain sampling this function, instead of $p(x)$ itself, has temperature $T$. For $T>1$, $p^{1/T}$ is smoothed out compared with $p$. This smoothed out distribution will be easier to move around than the original, especially when there are strong/complex degeneracies, and in particular it should be more likely for a chain to move between well separated peaks of the PDF. Of course, we're only actually interested in samples obtained for $T=1$, ultimately.\n",
    "\n",
    "With parallel tempering, we run one chain with $T=1$ and several more chains with $T>1$. A modified Metropolis-Hastings update occasionally allows the chains to exchange positions, giving the $T=1$ chain a mechanism for sampling regions of parameter space it might otherwise have low probability of proposing. Samples from the $T=1$ chain can be used for inference."

For parameters that are not conjugate, they typically fall back on basic one-parameter-at-a-time Metropolis sampling, so it's only worth investigating these packages if you know (or suspect) your problem has conjugacies to take advantage of."

    "Moving beyond Markov chain methods, the method of [Goodman and Weare (2010)](http://msp.org/camcos/2010/5-1/camcos-v5-n1-p04-p.pdf) works by evolving an ensemble of points in parameter space. After convergence, the ensemble can be regarded as a set of samples from the target distribution. This approach provides some of the benefits of running multiple chains, although we cannot interpret the evolution of the points in the ensemble as _independent_ chains in any sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure for moving each point (aka walker) in the ensemble is:\n",
    "1. Randomly pick a _different_ point from the ensemble (total size $N$).\n",
    "2. Propose a move in the direction of that point, by the distance between them multiplied by a random number from this distribution:\n",
    "$g(z) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt z}; ~ \\frac{1}{2}\\leq z \\leq 2$.\n",

    "\n",
    "This algorithm is relatively easy to use - there is no tuning required and it's straightforward to parallelize. One just needs to provide an initial ensemble, which is not much more onerous than providing a single initial state for MCMC. For these reasons, we lean on a Python implementation called `emcee` (feel free to groan) in some of the later tutorials. There are some important cautions to keep in mind, however.\n",
    "* This method can be **extremely** slow to finding the region where the posterior is large if it is not started there to begin with. Seriously. At least once a year, I get a question like \"Everything looked good and converged, until all of a sudden the distribution of walkers blew up and they went everywhere. What's broken?\" Nothing's broken. That potentially long early run that looks \"perfect\" is just walkers swapping with one another because they can't find a better move, perpetuating the original distribution of the ensemble. _Eventually_ they figure it out, at which point they will disperse throughout the (possibly much wider) posterior.\n",
    "* As the walkers are not independent in any sense, our usual methods for assessing convergence cannot necessarily be trusted (see the story above). Running two independent fits with ensembles started in different places is one possible solution, but that runs into the issue of possibly slow convergence when not starting near the peak probability. Starting with a very spread out ensemble is _kind of_ like chains with different starting positions, but again might be very slow to converge.\n",

With a suitably intelligent implementation (e.g. see [this](http://www.jstor.org/stable/27594084)), the generating distribution can be evolved towards the posterior distribution, providing samples for a posteriori analysis as well as an estimate for the evidence."

In brief, we begin with a large number of points sampled from the prior, and gradually evolve them towards higher-likelihood positions, keeping track of how the volume filled changes (marvel at the complicated math [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.3437)). Like PMC generally, every time we evaluate the likelihood we get a sample and a weight that we can use to derive parameter constraints, regardless of whether we even care about the evidence.\n",

    "By virtue of spamming the parameter space with points at the start, nested sampling is likely (though never guaranteed) to find multiple modes, if they exist. The same can be said of PMC, given a wide initial generating distribution. Since these methods maintain something like a global view of the parameter space, rather building up information by tracing a sequence through the space, they are probably the best option in the situation that confounds MCMC, when there are widely separated peaks in the posterior distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "If nested sampling is so much more foolproof than MCMC, why wouldn't we always use it instead? In short, exactly those features that make it more robust to multimodal distributions make it less efficient than MCMC for unimodal distributions - if our goal is simply to find the peak and the usual credible intervals/regions, we're better off looking around the region of parameter space where the posterior is large, rather than carefully mapping out the tails."
