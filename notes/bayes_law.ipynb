    "Bayes' Law is also frequently refered to as Bayes' Theorem or Bayes' Rule. One could argue that \"theorem\" is inappropriate, since a theorem is a statement that has been mathematically proven, whereas all we did was apply one of the axioms of probability. Of course, this apparent simplicity is due to several hundred years of development of probability as a branch of mathematics (including said axioms and the definition of conditioning). In any case, the importance of Bayes' Law is not in the impressiveness of its derivation, but in the insight that the formal language of probability is the natural (and correct) way to describe the knowledge we acquire from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also worth noting that, like many equations that have a name attached to them, Bayes' Law was neither fully appreciated by nor uniquely discovered by Bayes. He was apparently the first to write it down, though he didn't really do anything with it or even publish the derivation (it was published posthumously). Later, and independently, Laplace developed and applied the approach that we now call Bayesian analysis. Of course, a number of others contributed along the way to our modern formalism (Jeffreys, Cox and Jaynes being probably the most salient names).\n",

Just to be difficult, cosmologists like to write this as $\\rho_\\mathrm{m} \\propto \\Omega_\\mathrm{m} h^2$, where $\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}$ is the ratio of the matter density to the critical density, and $h$ is the Hubble constant in dimensionless form. If we expect our measurement to have comparable uncertainty to what has been done previously, then it might make sense to combine the two results. That is, we would set our prior on $\\rho_\\mathrm{m}$ equal to the posterior distribution of a previous (independent) experiment and use Bayes' Law to update our knowledge in light of the new data.\n",

    "Finally, recall that the two data sets needed to be conditionally independent for the simple expressions above to work. If not, then $p(x_1,x_2|\\theta) \\neq p(x_1|\\theta) p(x_2|\\theta)$. This happens in cosmology, for example, when $x_1$ and $x_2$ are two different tracers of the same underlying density field. In this case, assuming $\\theta$ refers to global cosmological parameters, $x_1$ and $x_2$ would not be conditionally independent - they each depend on local conditions like density that are implicitly marginalized over when writing $p(x_1,x_2|\\theta)$. We could expand the model to explicitly incorporate all this local information (think of a plate over **many** cells in position, $x,y,z$). More likely, we would just do a new, joint analysis of $x_1$ and $x_2$ when we obtained the second data set. This lack of conditional independence is why you might hear the word \"covariances\" thrown around a lot in cosmology circles."

For now, we will just want to look at a posteriori predictions for our measurements, that is, preditions for what we might measure (based on the sampling distribution) for parameter values drawn from the posterior distribution. This may sound circular, and it is - that's the point! If the predictions we make from the posterior don't resemble the data that went into determining that posterior to begin with, that would be a good indication that our model assumptions have failed somewhere.\n",

What we would do is draw many possible values of $\\mu$ from the posterior distribution, and, for each of those, draw one or more values of $N$ from the sampling distribution. From this we can build a histogram of predicted measurements (the posterior predictive distribution) to compare with the histogram of actual measurements, as below. (You may not be shocked to learn that, sometimes, the posterior predictive distribution is again a standard distribution with its own name. But we'll code up the random draws here anyway.)"

    "I don't know if this is still done, but I used to hear the term \"deboosting\" thrown around in the context of galaxy cluster masses. The mass function of clusters is steeply decreasing, and masses are incredibly hard to measure precisely. Hence, the mass estimate one gets from using a uniform prior tends to be greater than the best estimate one could make by accounting for the mass function. This is exacerbated by selection bias, which we will get to eventually. Something similar happens in redshift estimation of sources of all kinds, given that the number of sources tends to be a strong function of redshift. The point is: one _could_ go through some kind of convoluted \"deboosting\" procedure, or one could just choose a sensible prior and use the tools that Bayes, Laplace et al. gave us."
