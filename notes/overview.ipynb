    "**Dr. Adam Mantz** is a Research Scientist in the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC). He has a background in observational astrophysics and cosmology, specializing in studies of clusters of galaxies and the intracluster medium. Has has also, within recent memory, worked on medical imaging research in the Division of Oncology of the Stanford School of Medicine. He has been involved in the development and teaching of this course since its inception, and has adapted parts of it for the [LSSTC Data Science Fellowship Program](https://ciera.northwestern.edu/programs/lsstc-data-science-fellowship-program/).

    "Our goal is that students taking this course will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand and apply the principles underlying statistical inference from data, and the role of probabilistic modeling in inference\n",
    "    - Design and interpret generative models relevant to real astrophysical inference problems\n",
    "    - Use Bayesian analysis to infer posterior distributions and compare competing models, and produce appropriate quantitative summaries of such results\n",
    "    - Understand the distinction between Bayesian and frequentist approaches, and the circumstances in which they are approximately equivalent\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gain familiarity with various numerical algorithms used in statistical inference\n",
    "    - Implement, evaluate and compare brute-force and simple Markov chain monte carlo approaches to carrying out inference\n",
    "    - Understand and use diagnostics of the convergence and quality of posterior samples\n",
    "    - Practice using multiple software packages providing a wider range of sampling methods\n",
    "\n",
    "* Apply the above principles and skills to realistic astrophysical inference problems\n",
    "    - Design and use complex generative models including features such as hierarchical structures and selection effects\n",
    "    - Implement and evaluate combinations of sampling strategies, approximations and other practical tricks for solving challenging inference problems\n",
    "    - Work with real astrophysical data in several forms, performing inference to answer a variety of questions"

    "### What that means \n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, this class is about *how data are turned into conclusions*. The examples and tutorials are taken from astrophysics, but otherwise the content is extremely general.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be a little more concrete, consider this cartoon of the scientific process:\n",
    "* Propose observations/experiment\n",
    "* Collect and \"reduce\" data\n",
    "* **Explore and summarize the data**\n",
    "* **Hypothesize and test**\n",
    "* **Interpret, conclude**, speculate\n",
    "* Report\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Turning data into conclusions\" broadly refers to the **bold** items. In particular, we will not spend time on \"data reduction\", by which we mean the initial processing steps applied to raw data recorded by some instrument. These details tend to be highly specific to a given detector (or detector type), wavelength range, telescope system, and so on. On the other hand, we will be introducing and working with real astronomical data, so you'll get some experience with it if this is new to you. Even so, there's far too much variety for us to touch on every type of data you might encounter!\n",
    "\n",
    "This course will also be focused on a particular approach to drawing conclusions from data, known as Bayesian analysis. This is because, as we'll see, Bayes' Law provides a rigorous basis for formalizing what the phrase \"turning data into conclusions\" (more properly called _inference_) actually means. The upshot is that we will not be marching through a survey of ad hoc methods and the problems they might be applied to. Instead, the goal will be to carefully define the question we are asking of the data, and then decide what techniques and/or (justifiable) approximations will get us to an answer. This, we hope, will be appealing to students with a physics background.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this course aims to be _practical_. So, lest the previous paragraph give you the wrong idea, we will not have problem sets where you are asked to prove theorems or show that such-and-such is true. (No more than one, anyway.) With the exception of a bit of review at the start, the assigned problems will be tutorials that walk through a real-life analysis, albeit usually a simplified one, so that you gain experience putting the methods we will discuss into practice. The goal is that, by the end, you will be able to apply the reasoning and methods of Bayesian analysis in your own work."

    "### Aside: What this course is not\n",
    "\n",
    "Strictly speaking, any procedure applied to data could be called a \"statistical method\". However, not all such methods allow us to rigorously draw conclusions of interest - in full generality, all we can conclude from the application of some method is what the output of that method is. In contrast, our goal with inference is usually to learn something about a model from the data, not just the number(s) that an algorithm turns the data into. This requires quantifying the probability of various possibilities in light of the data, and this in turn means applying a principled, mathematical framework - or, at least, starting from one, even if we end up making approximations. That isn't to say that there's no place for other methods, but we think it's important and generally useful to understand Bayesian reasoning, regardless. Not to mention, it's enough to fill a quarter on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to be perfectly upfront, this class will not significantly delve into\n",
    "* frequentist statistical methods (though they will be covered somewhat)\n",
    "* so-called \"machine learning\" algorithms\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We use the Python programming language extensively, and it is _not_ generally feasible to substitute a different language. Some previous experience with Python, or the capacity and desire to pick it up _really, really_ fast, is therefore required. You do not need to have any particular experience beyond the basics, or with any specific packages like `numpy` or `scipy`, though it doesn't hurt. Prior exposure to mathematical calculations using `numpy` is particularly particular.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous exposure to the concepts and calculus of probability would be very helpful, though we will review them briefly. In this context, undergraduate quantum mechanics or statistical mechanics will do, as would (naturally) an undergraduate statistics/probability course. Again, this is a case where the amount of effort it takes to get going at the beginning of the course will depend on how much of the learning curve you've already climbed."

There is no textbook associated with the class, so the notes (in combination with the tutorials) are intended to be comprehensive.\n",

Often these will consist of a partially worked inference problem, where the code required to illustrate an understanding of the subject at hand is left out, and most other \"background noise\" code (the kind that doesn't demonstrate an understanding of statistics, yet is annoying to write) is provided. Normally, a tutorial notebook will have several \"checkpoints\" that test whether some portion of your code is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project:** Optionally, you can complete a project the form of a tutorial of your own design, allowing you to explore a data set of your choice and/or analysis methods beyond what the existing tutorials cover.\n",

    "* Textbook: None, as noted above.\n",
    "* Exams: Hahahahahaha. No exams.\n",
    "* Solutions: You will not at any point be provided with solutions to the tutorials. Please don't ask. This doesn't mean that you're on your own if you get stuck, since your fellow students and the instructor can be resources to help you. More immediately, you will know if your code is working properly by comparing your results with the checkpoints provided in the tutorials, as well as by comparing with the outputs of a compete notebook (these are linked from the front page)."
