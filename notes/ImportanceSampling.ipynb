    "#### The idea of importance sampling is at the core of another advanced technique called [Population Monte Carlo](http://www.jstor.org/stable/27594084) (PMC). In PMC, an approximation to the posterior distribution, called the generating distribution, is iteratively produced, along with a number of samples. Each iteration consists of\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Mathematically, this is straightforward enough, but clearly the selection of $q$ needs to be clever in order for the resulting points (weighted or not) to provide useful information about the posterior. The nice, if counterintuitive, thing about PMC is that the generating distribution can depend on the previous crops of points while still producing unbiased results, thanks to the explicit re-weighting. With a suitably clever implementation (not covered here!), the generating distribution can be evolved towards the posterior distribution, providing samples for a posteriori analysis as well as an estimate for the evidence."
