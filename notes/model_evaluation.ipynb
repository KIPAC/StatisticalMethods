    "In the [Bayes' Law](bayes_law.ipynb) notes, we introduced the idea of comparing the data to posterior predictions of the model, i.e. mock data generated from the posterior distribution. The logic here is similar to that of the frequentist test: we want to see whether the fitted model can produce data that look like ours. However, instead of only looking at data generated from the \"best-fitting\" parameters, the Bayesian approach accounts for posterior uncertainty by generating mock (or _replica_) data from parameters sampled from the posterior distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from this distinction, one can similarly define a suitable test statistic, and compare its value as computed from the real data with the **posterior predictive distribution** computed from the replica data. In general, we are free to design our test statistic to focus on whatever aspect of the data that we want the model to fit well.\n",

    "* If our model is the true one, then replica data generated by it should in some sense resemble the one dataset we have.\n",

If our value of $T$ from the real data turns out to be unlikely under the model, it doesn't necessarily mean that the model is wrong... just that our value of $T$ from the real data is unlikely under the model. Unlikely things happen! This is a weakness of the approach shared with frequentist hypothesis testing generally, and motivates the use of model _comparison_ (that is, explicitly asking whether one model is more likely than another), which we discuss more below. Nevertheless, posterior predictive checks are useful and relatively simple."

That argument, while technically still true, starts to sound a little absurd when we're talking about probabilities like $10^{-10}$, as with the second test. There isn't necessarily an ideal choice of test statistic in general; the log-likelihood is a common choice because of the analogy to $\\chi^2$ and because it can be applied in any situation, while other test statistics might be superior in a situation where we don't expect _any_ simple model to describe the data in detail, but want to find one that reproduces one particular aspect well."

    "The Bayesian approach is qualitatively different from other model assessments discussed above. While they focused primarily on prediction accuracy, here we simply apply Bayes' Law at the level of the model as a whole, with the evidence updating our prior knowledge into a posterior probability. There are no inherent mathematical limitations to this procedure, in contrast to various other hypothesis tests that are only valid under certain assumptions (such as the models being nested, e.g. the classical $F$ test for comparing $\\chi^2$ values). Any two models, no matter how fundamentally different, can be compared with this technique."

An quick and dirty alternative is the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which is an approximation of the evidence in the limit that that the data points greatly outnumber the parameters, and the priors are uninformative. However, the DIC is now a more common/recommended option for this situation, since it actually uses the information from the MCMC samples rather than just the maximum-likelihood point, as the BIC does.\n",
