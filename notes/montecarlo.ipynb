    "In principle, given samples from the posterior, we could estimate the density at any point using some form of kernel density estimator. However, as you saw in the notes on [credible regions](credible_regions.ipynb), the results we report are usually based on marginal posteriors over 1 or 2 parameters. In other words, we are ultimately interested in *integrals* of the posterior. These integrals can also be computed from a set of posterior samples using **Monte Carlo integration**, and in general the number of samples we need to accurately estimate the 1D and/or 2D marginal posteriors is far fewer than we would need to accurately estimate the full-dimensional posterior density."

    "How does this help us? Let's imagine we have a clever way of sampling from the posterior distribution, whatever it happens to be. If the posterior is 1D to begin with, we can simply estimate the posterior density based on the density of samples, e.g. by making a histogram, and find our best value and credible interval from there. But if the posterior is multi-dimensional, we will need to integrate it down to get a 1D marginal posterior for a single parameter. We can do that by simplemindedly using the approximation above, with $p$ being the posterior itself, and $w=1$. That is, if $\\theta$ is the parameter we care about and $\\phi$ are those we want to integrate out,\n",

    "This might look like it will be 1 all the time, but remember that the integral here is at a fixed value of $\\theta$. So, the corresponding sum is only over samples with that value of $\\theta$, and there are probably fewer than $n$ of them. (If it's still confusing, imagine modifying the above to integrate over both $\\phi$ and $\\theta$ - that certainly should return 1, since the posterior is normalized. Now, imagine straightforwardly removing the integral over $\\theta$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical terms, this means the that the correct procedure is the most straightforward thing one could imagine. If we have posterior samples, the way we estimate the 1D marginalized posterior of $\\theta$ is to ignore all other parameters and simply make a histogram of the $\\theta$ values from our samples, just like in the case where the posterior was 1D to begin with. Similarly, a 2D marginalized posterior would be estimated based on a 2D histogram made from the samples of just 2 parameters, regardless of what the other parameters are doing.\n",

We can do this _without_ generating more samples, by simply multiplying the weights with the likelihood associated with this second data set, and repeating whatever integrations we wanted to do (i.e., making new weighted histograms).

    "\n",
    "Before diving any further into the algorithms used for Bayesian analysis, it's worth reviewing the more fundamental approaches to generating pseudorandom numbers from some distribution. We won't normally use these procedures directly, but conceptually they play a role in the algorithms that we will use.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, let's get the terminology straight.\n",
    "* Random: not deterministic; predictable only in the sense of following a PDF. Computer algorithms do not produce random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pseudorandom: not random, but \"unpredictable enough\" for practical purposes. The usual \"random number generator\" algorithms that are standard, e.g. in `numpy`, actually produce pseudorandom sequences. Generally, these approximate the uniform distribution on the interval [0,1). These sequences depend on an initial state, called a seed, such that they are _completely predictable_ based on the seed. Hence notebooks or calculations that use pseudorandomness, but are intended to be reproducible, will explicitly set the seed of the random number generator at the outset. (We could have done that throughout this course to provide tutorial outputs that should _exactly_ match yours, but chose not to out of laziness.)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Quasirandom: not random, and \"more predicable\" in human terms than pseudorandom. A quasirandom sequence can therefore converge to the target PDF (in the sense of sampling it evenly and having the right mean, standard deviation, etc.) _more quickly_ than a truly random or pseudorandom. This can make them very useful for MC integration generally, although less so for our purposes, since we want to generate random-seeming samples as well as integrations. For example, one classic quasirandom sequence goes: $1/2, 1/4, 3/4, 1/8, 7/8, 3/8, 5/8, \\ldots$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we assume that we have a reliable source of uniform pseudorandom numbers, and need to transform them into samples from some other PDF. (In days past, we would caution you about the fact that these generators eventually repeat themselves - that is, the sequences are periodic - but the standard algorithms in `numpy` and similar packages have vastly longer periods than those that used to be the default for programmers in C and Fortran. Still, if you are generating initial conditions for some _huge_ N-body simulation, this would be something to watch out for.)"

It categorically is not a statement about the short-term behavior of the chain. We might investigate that by writing down $p(y|x)$ - that is, by conditioning on the previous position - which explicitly reveals the random-walk nature of the chain.

But, often enough, we are dealing with what you might call \"descriptive\" models, which tend to be built from simple functions and standard PDFs. In those cases, it's not so uncommon to have some conjugacies in the model. Since Gibbs sampling in these cases _can_ be much more efficient than alternatives, it's worth knowing about this method as an option.\n",

Classical least squares can't handle this, but the features above are hardly unusual in real-world problems."

But it's easy to contrive a PDF that Gibbs sampling or Metropolis would fail to characterize, namely one with multiple, widely separated peaks that can't plausibly be random-walked between. We could tackle this with Metropolis-Hastings if we knew where the peaks were ahead of time and used a custom proposal distribution. But a Gibbs sampler would be dead in the water, unless the peaks were displaced along the Cartesian directions of the parameter space, and a Metropolis kernel with a reasonable proposal size to sample one peak would struggle to find its way to a different peak. (Ok, strictly speaking any of these algorithms would be fine after an infinite number of steps, but who wants to wait that long?)\n",

In full generality, we would need to exhaustively search the parameter space to be sure. Short of that, we could run many independent chains with widely separated starting points and see where they end up. (As you may know, this is also a generic issue in numerical optimization, nothing specific to MCMC.) If we do find that our PDF has multiple, widely separated peaks, there are other algorithms that will work better, which we will look at later on.\n",

Solid gold meteor striking the person who asked that question in a conference _at the exact moment of the question mark_ unlikely. You get the idea.\n",
