    "\n",
    "* Course: Physics 267\n",
    "* Units: 3 (letter of credit/no credit)\n",
    "* Prerequisites: Programming in Python or a similar language at the level of CS 106A. Recommended but not required: probability at the level of STATS 116, CS 109 or PHYSICS 166/266. (See the [overview](overview.ipynb#Prerequisites) for what this actually means.)\n",

    "The course is pitched at a graduate level, albeit an unusual one (for Physics) in that it doesn't assume much in the way of previous coursework. Undergraduates are welcome to join, and have been known to use the class to satisfy the Physics major's practicum requirement (with a waiver), but are reminded that this is not officially a cross-listed undergrad/grad class. The upshot of this is that the pace is typical of a graduate course, i.e. faster than a typical undergraduate course.\n",
    "\n",
    "For physics graduate students: this course is considered \"Other\" for the purposes of the breadth requirement. That is, it counts as breadth even for those specializing in astrophysics. This, we claim, is because we do not actually cover any astrophysics in this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Students and postdocs may audit **with the instructor's approval**. They will be expected to engage with the course at the same level as an enrolled student. If you're not prepared to do so, you may as well read/work through the materials on the web at your own pace, which is why they're there."

The same can be true of interactions outside of class, such as collaborating on problems, but class is the best opportunity we have to collectively get on the same page and test our understanding of the material. It's also when we will launch new tutorials, so it's an invaluable opportunity to get any immediate questions answered in real time. The default expectation is that everyone will attend and participate in class. Exceptions can be made for conflicts with specific class days (e.g. due to conference travel); these should be brought to our attention ahead of time. It goes without saying that illness is an acceptable reason to miss class. Remote participation in class via Zoom is not workable as a matter of course, though limited collaboration may be possible under special circumstances. \n",

(This includes the ur-question, which goes, \"Wait... could you explain that again?\")[$^1$](#Note-1)\n",

We might send a submitted notebook back with a requested revision or fix required for it to be deemed complete (usually with some advice about how to proceed).

Very simply, you will not be able to participate effectively in the review if you are seeing the tutorial for the first time at that point.\n",

    "This might all sound intimidating, but our aim with these notebooks is to make them illuminating rather than onerous. We want you to get your hands dirty analyzing data, and as long as that happens we'll be happy. Given all this flexibility, and since everyone should have working and complete notebooks by the time we're done, we are not planning on providing \"solutions\". You can, however, find html pages showing the outputs of solved tutorials linked from the main github.io page, to compare your work to."
