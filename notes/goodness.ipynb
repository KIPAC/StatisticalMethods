If the mock data predicted by the model, when the model has already been fitted, don't resemble the data used in the fit then we have reason to suspect that the model is incomplete. In mathematical notation, if we call our real data $x$ and mock data $x'$, we want to compare $x$ with the predicted distribution of $x'$ conditioned on $x$, $p(x'|x)$.\n",

We are not, however, conditioning on any particular choice for the values of the parameters, $\\theta$. Instead, it makes sense to allow $\\theta$ to vary within its posterior distribution. Saying that the model is adequate to explain the data is more or less equivalent to saying that somewhere within the posterior for $\\theta$ are values that could produce the observed data. So it makes sense that $\\theta$ doesn't appear in the expression $p(x'|x)$; $\\theta$ should be marginalized over, and in particular marginalized over the posterior, $p(\\theta|x)$. We can write this down in math using the definition of marginalization,\n",

    "Despite having a prior about twice as wide (in standard deviation), $H_3$ ends up being modestly favored because it is more compatible with the data. Both models are still reasonable - consider how wide the the likelihood curve is above - but the evidence would clearly nudge us towards prefering $H_3$ to $H_2$."

    "This particular set of notes contains a mix of the immediately useful, and things we will not really take advantage of until later on. This is because the utility of the evidence, and test statistics to a lesser extent, is limited while we are still working with very simple inference problems. Before we see these ideas in action, we will need to cover the numerical techniques that make it possible to solve more complex inference problems than those we have seen so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, a simple, qualitative check of goodness of fit by comparing (in some form) posterior predictions with the data is **always** a good idea, and something we should do **every time** we fit a model. Like explicitly building a generative model by mapping it out with a PGM, this is a habit you are advised to intentionally cultivate - it will certainly save you from heartbreak later on."
