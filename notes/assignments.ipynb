    "To get the tutorial notebooks and supporting files, the easiest option is to download the current version of the course's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/KIPAC/StatisticalMethods). From the linked page, click the green \"Code\" button and select \"Download ZIP\". Files can also be downloaded individually, but since some notebooks depend on additional files, it's simplest to get everything at once. We don't particularly advise _cloning_ the repository, because it's unnecessarily very large compared with what we actually need.\n",

    "## Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "We anticipate significant variety in the projects people pursue. Broadly speaking, the only requirements are that they must represent an application of the principles we cover in class, and be original work. Projects absolutely **can** be part of your own research, and/or something you were going to do anyway (provided you haven't _already_ done it). Projects can also _not_ be part of your own research; that's obviously fine. You can also design a project without a specific research application in mind, simply to explore some concept or methodology that goes beyond what's in the tutorials. Frequently, especially when dealing with research-relavent projects, it will be necessary to scale back ambitions and solve a simplified version (e.g. on simulated data). We will be consulting with you to help define projects and scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though one can imagine exceptions, normally a project would include the same elements that are present in many of the tutorials:\n",
    "  * an introduction to the data being analyzed;\n",
    "  * an explanation of the model being investigated;\n",
    "  * discussion of how the inference was accomplished computationally, including any approximations that were necessary;\n",
    "  * visualization of the results, including vetting for convergence;\n",
    "  * discussion of how you would, given more time, extend this analysis - including conclusions of what worked well, and what did not.\n",
    "  \n",
    "About halfway through the course, we will collectively brainstorm project ideas, so that you can identify teams if desired. Thereafter, there will be a few _very brief_ in-class status updates to make sure things are on track (and more extensive consultations outside of class, if needed). The final deliverables will be\n",
    "* A presentation, normally to be delivered in the final class meeting (or the penultimate class, depending on how many projects there are). Presentations can optionally be scheduled earlier than this, if you want to get early feedback from the class. The presentation should be pitched at a level understandable to your classmates, and cover the points above. The time available will depend on the class size, but typically we expect about 10 minutes minimum per project, or about 5 minutes per team member, with 5 minutes for questions afterwards.\n",
    "* A written report, produced using LaTeX (a markup language used for most physics publications). While the report's format is broadly that of a journal article, you should provide adequate detail throughout (as described above) even though this may go beyond what would normally appear in a journal. All members of the group are coauthors of the report, and any substantive contributions from other students (e.g. through discussions) should be acknowledged. There is no required length to the report, other than \"as long as it needs to be\"; typically they come in at 5-10 pages (longer if there are tons of figures).\n",
    "\n",
    "All reports will be composed as \"chapters\" within the same Overleaf project, which you will be given access to. Some more specific instructions as to how this works, and a very basic introduction to LaTeX, can be found there. Consequently, there is nothing special you need to do to turn in the report; we will simply download the entire project at the appropriate time. Do ensure that your project's report compiles, and refrain from breaking any code elsewhere in the repository. Once the quarter is over, we'll compile all the reports into a snazzy and nearly professional-looking booklet, and distribute it to the class. Please note that the titles and abstracts of the reports will be shared with future students to stimulate their creativity (though the reports' content will not be).\n",

    "### Proprietary data\n",
    "\n",
    "While the opportunity to collaborate with your classmates on a genuine research project is, we think, beneficial, be aware that real research often involves data that is proprietary to an existing collaboration. Collaborations vary as to how open they are to allowing outsiders access to the data, or involving them in any sort of analysis. The last thing we want is for one of you to provide genuinely useful contributions to some research project, potentially leading to authorship/coauthorship of a publication, only to find the wrath of bureaucracy coming down on you. Please be sure to check (probably with your advisor) if you think an issue like this might arise. Normally, they can be dealt with, as long as they are identified in advance."
