    "Now that you've gained some experience carrying our Bayesian inference, it's time to face the fact that real life is often more complicated than the problems we've worked so far. Some common features include:\n",

    "* Measurement uncertainty for *every* measured quantity\n",

(Insert the spicy adjective of your choice before \"Universe\", if you'd like.) Recalling our notes on [generative models](generative_models.ipynb), that means that any of these effects that apply deserve to be represented in our model. In fact, all of them can in principle be handled by expanding the model appropriately, introducing nuisance parameters to encode whatever is uncertain or stochastic. The particular case of selection effects is explored more in [another notebook](missingdata.ipynb), and all of the above issues show up somewhere (usually multiple somewheres) in the course tutorials, so you will get some practice with them. In the remainder of these notes, we will see how the commonly hierarchical structure of models naturally accomodates these complexities, and look at some of the strategies that are employed when we don't want to commit to a physically motivated model."

    "The general form for a hierarchical model goes like this:\n",
    "* $p(\\mathrm{data}|\\theta)$ describes the measurement process (what we've been calling the sampling distribution),\n",
    "* $p(\\theta)$ decomposes as $p(\\theta|\\phi_1)\\,p(\\phi_1)$,\n",

    "* $\\ldots$,\n",
    "* $p(\\phi_n)$, usually taken to be \"uninformative\"\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, a model is hierarchical if there is at least 1 non-deterministic step between the data and the farthest-upstream stochastic parameter. For example, the following, equivalent PGMs from the [Bayes' Law](bayes_law.ipynb) notes are **not** hierarchical.\n",

In modeling terms, the notion of a class implies that some parameter(s) describing the sources arise from a common distribution, rather than being completely unrelated to one another. In other words, even though the individual parameters describe individual objects, it's fair to apply a common prior distribution to them; the prior parameters describe the statistical properties of the source class. In statistics, the applicability of hierarchical models is related to the concept of **exchangeability** - meaning that, a priori, individual sources of a given class are equivalent.

The mixture model provides a straightforward way to marginalize over the class assignment of every source.\n",

The cost of this simplification is that we now have to sample the $g$ parameters in order to marginalize over them.

A different circumstance where mixture models can be useful is we simply don't have a well motivated form for some distribution, $p(y)$, appearing in our model, and want to marginalize over a more flexible range of possibilities than a single, standard PDF would provide. In this case, there is no need to associate the individual components of the mixture with anything physical, nor is there necessarily any meaning to the posterior classifications.

    "A nice feature of Gaussian processes is that all the calculations involved in the conditioning above are algebraic. In other words, if we know the value of the function at some set of $x_i$ (all the stuff conditioned on above), it's relatively easy to compute the PDF of the function value at some other $x$. Similarly, under reasonable assumptions, differentiation and integration of a Gaussian process are algebraic (citation needed).\n",

But, typically, we are more interested in the posterior prediction, drawn from $P[y(x^*)\\vert y_{\\rm obs}(x_{\\rm obs})]$, where $x_{\\rm obs}$ are the locations where we know the function and $x^*$ is some other location. This posterior PDF for $y(x^*)$ is a Gaussian, whose mean and standard deviation can be computed algebraically, and which is constrained by _all the previously observed $y(x)$_. In its simplest form, all curves $y(x^*)\\vert y_{\\rm obs}(x_{\\rm obs})$ with non-zero probability pass through the points $(x_{\\rm obs},y_{\\rm obs})$ exactly. However, the formalism for all these calculations easily extends to the case where our measurements, $y_{\\rm obs}$, come from a Gaussian sampling distribution rather than being known perfectly.\n",

    "Possibly the most widespread use of GPs in astrophysics has been to model the cosmic expansion (e.g. [this article](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012PhRvD..85l3530S/abstract)). In this context, the idea is not that the GP provides a _physical_ model for the expansion rate, only that it provides a physics-free (though not assumption-free) alternative to making predictions from a particlar cosmological model. Typically, the formalism would then be used to decide whether GPs constrained by different data sets are compatible with one another, or whether a GP constrained from data is compatible with a particular physical model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that here the GP describes the expansion rate (and/or luminosity distance, angular diameter distance, etc.) as a function of redshift, and redshifts can (spectroscopically) be measured so precisely that they may as well be fixed, this application matches well the requirements to take advantage of all the algebraic speedups available. That is, the $x_\\mathrm{obs}$ where we have observations, $y_\\mathrm{obs}$, to condition on can be assumed to be known without uncertainty, one of the necessary assumptions for the algebraic magic to happen. In situations like this, the use of a GP model is sometimes called Gaussian Process Regression, since it can be seen as a generalization of classical regression by (least squares)."

    "In GP regression context, the posterior width is typically understood as our uncertainty on the function being modeled. In principle, however, GPs can also model functions that have intrinsic scatter. In the same way that a Gaussian PDF can model a mean and intrinsic variance in some quantity (e.g. the star formation rate for galaxies of a given mass), a GP would encode a mean function and intrinsic _covariance_ (e.g. star formation rate as a function of radius for galaxies of a given mass). The latter would determine, for example, whether deparures from the mean function are coherent across a wide range in $x$ (the whole function being scaled up or down, in the extreme case), versus being less coherent (as in a particular realization wiggling back and forth across the mean many times as a function of $x$).\n",

The decision of what covariance kernel to use for a given application may also be challenging. In practice, problems like this are often discretized - that is, conceptually there is a GP model, but really we just fit a multidimensional Gaussian PDF to measurements at a standard set of $x_\\mathrm{obs}$ (possibly using some form of interpolation to translate the original data to these $x$ values), reducing the problem to fitting a vector of mean values and a covariance matrix of a given size."

    "The last case, if we discount the GP inspiration, is an example of what is inaccurately called a \"non-parametric\" model. Here the idea is that we can avoid assuming a functional form for some part of our model by instead parametrizing the function in question as a series of values at given abcissa and interpolating as needed. Such a model is neither non-parametric (note the word \"parametrizing\" in the previous sentence); in fact, they often have a large number of parameters. Nor are they free of modeling assumptions, such as those inherent in the choice of interpolator and the number and positioning of abscissa. But, assuming those decisions can be made in a principled way, they do provide an alternative to a physically motivated model, should that be desirable."

After all, there are many ways in which models can become complex, and no single right way to handle that complexity. Similarly, while additional complexity almost invariably means more model parameters, there is no single best strategy to dealing with that computational challenge. There are a number of strategies beyond brute force MCMC that can simplify things, and there's a certain amount of artistry involved in choosing and carrying them out, as with any difficult numerical calculation. We'll see some in the tutorials here in the latter part of the course (and maybe in projects that you define). Indeed, getting you to this point, and then providing hands-on experience with realistically complex problems (\"coping with reality\", you might say) is one of the central goals of this course.
