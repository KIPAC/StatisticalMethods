So, sources of \"error\" (things that introduce variability into the measured value) logically belong to the model, and become part of the prediction. They do not belong to the data.\n",

We will, therefore, stick with the \"data are constants\" maxim until we can discuss the specific circumstances when this shortcut is justified. **Doing so will avoid some common and serious pitfalls**, I promise.\n",

    "To belabor the point slightly more, consider a simplified version of the above example (in which I will lean on simplified, \"rule of thumb\" stats as it is usually taught). I've measured the number of occurrences of a rare event in my detector in some time (say, photons from a very dim star). I recognize that most of the generative model will boil down to calculating the predicted mean number of photons we expect to detect in that time, with the actual number recorded being given by the Poisson distribution for that mean.\n",

    "Say I measured 9 blips. What's the error bar? Well, I remember that error bar usually means \"standard deviation\", and the standard deviation of the Poisson distribution is the square root of its mean. My best (and only) estimate of the mean is the number that I got, 9. So, $9 \\pm 3$.\n",

If the plan was to use the measured number of blips $\\pm$ error to estimate the underlying Poisson mean (or some upstream quantity like the star's flux) and its uncertainty, then this last case is clearly nonsense. Measuring zero photons doesn't mean that the star has a flux of zero _with absolute certainty_, just that it's very dim (and/or the observation was very short, and/or the telescope was very small). But surely there are non-zero if small fluxes that my measurement does not rule out. Instead of getting caught up assigning fictitious error bars to the data, I should have instead accepted that they are constants, and focused on inferring (with uncertainties) the thing that I actually cared about, the star's flux. We'll see how to do this soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key feature here is that the uncertainty in the prediction of our generative model depended on the model parameter value - it could not be something attached to the data _independent_ of the model. The centrality of the Poisson distribution in this case made that explicit, but this is the general case. We should be thinking of uncertainties as belonging to the model by default, and recognize that attaching them to the data as \"error bars\" is a shortcut that is only _sometimes_ justified."

The BCG positions are determined essentially perfectly (that is, we can assume that the measured BCG position is its true position), but the measured X-ray centroids come with a Gaussian statistical uncertainty of typically $\\approx30$ kpc (standard deviation) in both the $x$ and $y$ directions.

    "It may seem nonintuitive to begin a course on statistical methods with a lesson on generative models, which might appear to be intended for creating fictional data. So, let's take a moment to reiterate what a generative model is, what it is not, and why we're doing this.\n",
    "\n",
    "A generative model is a model in the physics sense - that is, a conceptualization, probably approximate, describing some system or process. In this case, the model is meant to describe the process by which the numbers we call data come to be. It will typically, therefore, include a physical description of whatever object we're looking at, as well as a description of the measurement process itself. Also typically, a generative model will **begin** with the physical model, and **end** with the data, since that's the generative (causal) direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Critically, while the generative model incorporates details of how our measurements are made, it is something we should be able to design without having seen or even collected the data. We are not yet in a position to say what values of the model parameters would produce the observed data. What's important is that the model be complete enough to make predictions about _possible_ data that could be produced by a given set of parameter values.\n",
    "\n",
    "A generative model is **not** a description for what we will do with the data to learn the parameter values, or about the physical model more generally. This is a key conceptual distinction from the way statistical analysis is most commonly taught, in which the focus is on doing calculations with the data to produce estimates of the parameters of an underlying model. Reiterating and expanding on the points above, the generative process encoded in the model may not depend in any way on the data themselves - the data are the endpoint. We will, of course, be doing calculations that involve the data very soon (starting with [Bayes' Law](bayes_law.ipynb)). But, before that, we need to be able to describe with concrete, numerically evaluatable relationships, the path from the physical model to the recorded data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us to why we are starting with this subject: because a complete generative model automatically specifies all of the ingredients we will need to do Bayesian inference. The information encoded in the generative model, combined with the specific values of the data, fully determines what our inferences will be. Since the data are constants, it's not entirely unreasonable to say that the analyst's main job is to build the appropriate generative model for them. (This ignores the sometimes daunting task of carrying out the actual computations... but we'll get to all that.) Building the appropriate model requires having an understanding of the measurement process and being clear about exactly what the data are. For example, the reason we identified the data as a number of counts in the flux-measurement example, rather than a \"measured flux\" derived by going backwards to $F_k$ through the relationships we enumerated, is that only for counts could we specify the random process involved in producing the data (Poisson, under typically satisfied assumptions).\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, we begin our journey with generative models because they're absolutely fundamental to everything that comes afterwards. This course won't provide you with a menu of equations to plug through when handed data of one type or another. It will, we hope, provide you with the tools to draw inferences from data using the appropriate generative model for those data - and since you, not us, are the expert on your science and your data, the responsibility for building that model lies with you."

The game is executing a fully deterministic program, so in reality there is no uncertainty about whether the frog will be smooshed if it hops into the road at a given time. The player is missing this key information, but can still, in principle, make predictions about how likely the frog is to be smooshed at any given time using probabilistic modeling. With repeated experimentation, they could even refine this model to make it more accurate. As far as the player is concerned, whether there is an obstacle in the road is _functionally_ random, despite the underlying mechanics being non-random."
