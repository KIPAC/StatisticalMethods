    "# Notes: Approximate Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in this course we have focused on covering the process and methods of principled inference, and putting them into practice. Hopefully, this all seems possible, at least in the context of tutorials guiding you through pre-solved problems. In real life, however, it's very easy to end up in a situation where plugging through this process to generate samples from the posterior distribution appears to be computationally impossible in a reasonable amount of time. What then?\n",
    "\n",
    "The short answer, as far as these notes go, is: don't give up. There are a strategies that could be described as approximate methods that fit within the formalism we've been using, as we'll summarize below."

    "## But first... we we really _need_ new methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "Apologies for the exasperating question, but it really is worth asking. We try to keep the computing overhead for this class low enough that an old laptop can churn through any tutorial in at most a couple of minutes tops, but that's because we're just as impatient as you are. (Or more, considering that we have to run all of them that are turned in...) For real life problems, having to wait a few hours, or days, or even weeks, depending on the importance/finality of the inference might be fine. High-performace computing is obviously a great resource if you have access to it, and MCMC is famously \"embarassingly parallelizable\".\n",
    "\n",
    "But let's assume that simple impatience is not the issue. The next thing to ask is whether the theoretical part of the model, whatever it is, can be justifiably approximated and its evaluation thus sped up. Cows may not be spherical, but simplifying the description of complex phenomena, what it's defensible to do so, is a big part of science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last, we can think of ways to make the inference algorithms we already have work faster. There's a reason we spend so much time on methods in this course instead of just introducing `pymc` and calling it a day. It's because mindless, brute-force application of any of the methods we've covered, even the fanciest, will not be efficient all the time. When efficiency really matters, applying some human intelligence can be a game changer. Since all samplers that we know of bog down when the dimensionality of the parameter space becomes large, a recommended approach is to see if the number of parameters _to be sampled_ can be reduced. For example,\n",
    "* by taking advantage of conjugacies (this is still sampling the parameters, but potentially much more efficiently than generic methods);\n",
    "* by marginalizing over some parameters through direct (analytic or numerical) integration;\n",
    "* by constraining _intermediate_ posterior distributions before combining the information in them (in hierarchical problems).\n",
    "\n",
    "Several of the \"Practice\"-level tutorials explore these tricks. For the rest of these notes, we'll assume that they won't cut it, and we do need to approximate."

    "## Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, you've rolled your eyes through the previous section and determined that it really is necessary to find an alternative to traditional MCMC methods. The next contender for consideration is Approximate Bayesian Computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "ABC is a family of sampling methods all based on the idea that if we can generate a mock dataset that is sufficiently similar to the observed data, then the parameters of that model are a plausible draw from the posterior PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach the likelihood function is never explicitly evaluated, and so it is sometimes described as being \"likelihood-free\". This terminology is misleading at best since ABC relies on a generative model; as you well appreciate, a generative model is not complete with a sampling distribution, and sampling distributions are equivalent to likelihood functions. That said, there are situations when we can generate from a sampling distribution much more easily than we can evaluate its density. This is the use case for ABC."

    "Suppose we have a data set $d$, and a generative model, $H$, with parameters $\\theta$. The simplest ABC algorithm is as follows:\n",
    "* Draw $\\theta$ from the prior PDF, $p(\\theta|H)$.\n",
    "* Generate a mock data set, $d'$.\n",
    "* Compute the \"distance\" between the observed and mock datasets, $\\rho(d,d')$.\n",
    "* If the distance $\\rho(d,d') < \\varepsilon$, store $\\theta$ as a sample. Otherwise, reject it.\n",
    "* Repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the \"distance\", $\\rho$, is a function we can choose. Typically it is not practical to compute the distance between datasets $\\rho(d,d')$ directly. Instead, we first reduce the data into a set of summary statistics, $S(d)$, whose dimensionality is smaller than that of $d$. We then reject samples if $\\rho[S(d),S(d')] = \\rho(d,d') < \\varepsilon$. (Note that the difference in likelihoods would make an excellent distance metric, if we could compute it!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we get to choose $\\varepsilon$, with the goal being to make it small enough that our approximation to the posterior is good.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may recognize a similarity to rejection sampling (or Metropolis-Hastings) above. What ABC gives us is samples from $p(\\theta | \\rho[d,d'(\\theta)] < \\varepsilon, H)$. If $\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0$, this will be exactly the true posterior, $p(\\theta | d, H)$. If $\\varepsilon \\rightarrow \\infty$, it will instead be the prior, $p(\\theta|H)$. In practice, what we get is something in between, and the hope is that with a small enough $\\varepsilon$ it will be close to the posterior, while still not rejecting in too many iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might guess, this method requires some care. If the summary statistics are not close to being _sufficient statistics_[$^1$](#Note-1) for $\\theta$ (i.e. encoding all of the information the data have about $\\theta$), the approximate posterior will be too broad. If we try to use too many summary statistics, it may be too difficult for mock data sets to match the real data. If $\\varepsilon$ is not set correctly, sampling can be either too inefficient or not meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, we're left with an approximate posterior, and need to decide whether it's adequate for our purposes. Here posterior prediction and cross-validation can help.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting again that the algorithm above is the _simplest_ ABC implementation. As with MCMC, there are a number of modifications that can make it more efficient (in the sense of requiring fewer rejections), potentially allowing us to be more demanding with our choice of $\\varepsilon$. In fact, the implementations listed below use a version of population monte carlo, adaptively updating the distribution sampled from and reducing $\\varepsilon$ to gradually approach the true posterior.\n",

    "\n",
    "The use of a set of summary statistics in place of a larger data set in ABC is an example of \"dimensionality reduction\", a generally effective and practical way to avoid computational overheads. Whether under that name or not, and whether within the context of ABC or not (usually not), this approach is ubiquitous. In general, the idea is to reduce (literally) the data  by compressing it into a form that can be modeled with a much smaller number of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any time we truncate a generative model before it goes all the way to the rawest form of recorded data, we are in principle engaging in dimensionality reduction. Usually this is well justified, particularly if the sampling distribution for the reduced model is well understood. However, it's worth questioning whether simple dimensionality reduction, as opposed to ABC, is a good idea when the sampling distribution of the reduced model is something we can only guess at (including arguing for the central limit theorem and/or doing simulations)."

We presumably cannot find its mean and covariance algebraically, but finding them numerically would at least involve a limited number of evaluations compared with exploring a more complex PDF. In particular, a Gaussian has a single peak, so numerical optimization (e.g. by gradient descent) might well take us there.\n",

This is not an issue we have come across yet, since step one of our approach has been to specify a generative model, including a sampling distribution. In fact, our usual advice when faced with uncertainty about the nature of sampling distribution itself is still to model it, possibly in multiple ways and applying model selection if necessary. On those occasions when the data set is so small that such an approach doesn't seem likely to be fruitful, and if we are ultimately interested in a simple function of the data (like an estimator), resampling methods are a plausible alternative."

For example, the standard estimators for the intercept and slope might be useful summaries for a linear model, even if the assumptions underlying them do not actually hold in a given problem."
