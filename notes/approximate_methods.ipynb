    "\"Big data\" might refers to any data set whose _volume_, _velocity_ or _variety_ is sufficiently high that we need to fundamentally change the way we approach it. For example: SDSS gave astronomy a big data problem, in that we needed web-based SQL queries to allow us to make initial subsamples that we can work with. In the before time, we would have just downloaded the whole dataset.\n",

    "Consider an $N$-dimensional hypersphere of radius $R$. With a little algebra, you can show that the fraction of the sphere's volume contained in a thin shell at the surface approaches 1 for large $N$. More intuitively, thinking about cubes in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions, more and more of the total volume is found in the \"corners\" of the space.\n",
    "\n",
    "A consequence of this is that uniform priors become harder to justify (all that weight in the corners!), and similarly methods like SMC that sample from the prior will become increasingly inefficient in high dimensions (unless those priors are very informtive). MCMC sampling can go a long way to helping, but it inevitably becomes more challenging to move around a high-dimensional space, unless the posterior is very simple."

Rather then hierarchically model all this structure, with cosmological hyper-parameters, we compress the shape data into \"correlation function\" summary statistics. Importantly, these summary statistics can be directly predicted (on average) from a cosmological model, without having to generate a specific realization of the large scale structure. There is an issue, however: the exact form of the sampling distribution for the correlation function summary data is unknown (and dependent on cosmology)."

On the other hand, if we no longer understand the sampling distribution from first principles, as in the example above, we need a different approach. Options include\n",

    "### Approximate Bayesian Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "ABC is a family of sampling methods all based on the idea that if we can generate a mock dataset that is similar to the observed data, then the parameters of that model are a plausible draw from the posterior PDF. These methods might be useful when the model is  too complex to enable a likelihood to be evaluated (or even written down).\n",
    "\n",
    "When might that be? The cosmic shear example, without dimensional reduction, is one scenario. The only way to construct a PDF over possible sheared skies would be by brute force: realizing intial conditions and simulating the growth of structure and galaxy evolution many times from the same set of cosmological/astrophysical parameters. If we're reduced to doing such forward simulations anyway, ABC provides a better alternative (analogously to the improvement of MCMC over exhaustive grid evaluations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset $d$, and a generative model, $H$, with parameters $\\theta$. The simplest ABC algorithm is as follows:\n",
    "* Draw $\\theta$ from the prior PDF $p(\\theta|H)$.\n",
    "* Generate a mock dataset $d'$.\n",
    "* Compute the \"distance\" between the observed and mock datasets, $\\rho(d,d')$.\n",
    "* If the distance $\\rho(d,d') < \\epsilon$, store $\\theta$ as a sample. Otherwise, reject it.\n",
    "* Repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the \"distance\", $\\rho$, is a function we can choose. Typically it is not practical to compute the distance between datasets $\\rho(d,d')$ directly. Instead, we first reduce the data into a set of summary statistics $S(d)$, and then reject samples if $\\rho(S(d),S(d')) = \\rho(d,d') < \\epsilon$. (Note that the difference in likelihoods would make an excellent distance, if we could compute it!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we get to choose $\\epsilon$, although the goal is for it to be small enough that our approximation is good.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may recognize a similarity to rejection sampling (or Metropolis-Hastings) above. What ABC gives us is samples from $p(\\theta | \\rho(d,d') < \\epsilon, H)$. If $\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0$, this will be exactly the true posterior, $p(\\theta | d, H)$. If $\\epsilon \\rightarrow \\infty$, it will instead be the prior, $p(\\theta|H)$. In practice, what we get is something in between, and the hope is that with a small enough $\\epsilon$ it will be close to the posterior, while still not requiring too many rejected mocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might guess, this method requires some care. If the summary statistics are not close to being _sufficient statistics_ for $\\theta$, the approximate posterior will be too broad. (A sufficient statistic is one that retains all the information the data have about $\\theta$.) If we try to use too many summary statistics, it may be too difficult for mock data sets to match the real data. If $\\epsilon$ is not set correctly, sampling can be either too inefficient or not meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, we're left with an approximate posterior, and need to decide whether it's adequate for our purposes. Here posterior prediction and cross-validation can help.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting again that the algorithm above is the _simplest_ ABC implementation. As with MCMC, there are a number of modifications that can make it more efficient (in the sense of requiring fewer rejections), potentially allowing us to be more demanding with our choice of $\\epsilon$."

    "Short of that, we can hope that the central limit theorem makes our real posterior distribution approximately Gaussian. We may not be able to find its mean and covariance algebraically, but finding them numerically would at least involve a limited number of evaluations compared with exploring a more complex PDF. In particular, a Gaussian has a single peak, so numerical optimization (e.g. by gradient descent) might well take us there.\n",
