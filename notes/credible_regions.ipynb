    "## Summarizing 1D posterior distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "The posterior distribution is The Answer to an inference problem, but a PDF over potentially many dimensions is a cumbersome beast. Often, what we want to do is summarize the constraints on one or more parameters with a statement like $\\theta = \\theta_0 \\pm \\Delta\\theta$ or $\\theta = \\theta_0{}_{-\\Delta\\theta_m}^{+\\Delta\\theta_p}$. These should be interpreted as statements about the *marginal* posterior of $\\theta$, namely that $\\theta$ is in the given **credible interval** (CI) with some specified probability. To be explicit, if $\\theta$ is the parameter of immediate interest, and $\\phi$ are all the other parameters, the marginal posterior distribution of $\\theta$ is\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that credible intervals/regions are technically different from the confidence intervals/regions that appear in non-Bayesian statistics, which we'll touch on in later notes. Unfortunately, in practice, the terms are often used interchangeably. Apologies in advance if that happens in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Saying that a 68% CI contains a probability of 0.68 doesn't uniquely tell us _how_ to define the interval, nor what \"best\" value we should report as $\\theta_0$, and in practice there are multiple conventions. Let's look at a few of them."

    "Quite simply, this convention would report as $\\theta_0$ the mode of the marginal posterior. The credible interval is the (possibly multiply connected, i.e. consisting of multiple, disjoint intervals) interval _of largest posterior density_ that contains the specified probability. Consequently, it is also the smallest possible interval containing the target probability.\n",

    "**Disadvantages:** When the CI is multiply connected (the second case, but highly unusual in my limited experience), it's more annoying to describe. Also, when we use Monte Carlo methods to characterize the posterior, we will need to use kernel density estimation (a fancy way to say \"smoothing a histogram\") to get a smooth function from a finite number of samples; the precise value of the mode and CI limits can be rather sensitive to these details, though generally not at a level that matters (see Significant Digits, above). This means that a human needs to at least look at the distribution to verify that the results are ok (horrors!). I know of exactly one Python package that computes this style of CI correctly, including the multiply connected case, and it's the one I wrote (so, you know, tech support is questionable)."

    "One reason to look at 2D posteriors is that they reveal _degeneracies_ between parameters, i.e. loci in parameter space in which the posterior is constant or slowly changing. In the example below, you can see that the posterior for each analysis shown has a degeneracy between the parameters $\\sigma_8$ and $\\gamma$, but the direction and strength of these degeneracies (roughly, the orientation of the contours and how drawn out they are) vary. Here we can see that jointly analyzing all 3 data sets could result in much tighter constraints, since the area where the posteriors are simultaneously large is relatively small, something that might not be obvious from the 1D posterior distributions alone.\n",

    "Generally, a 1D CI will have a smaller extent in a given parameter than the 2D CR for the same contained probability. This is not a bug, but follows from the fact that the 1D marginalized posterior is integrated over an additional degree of freedom compared with the 2D one, which can result in the 1D PDF being more sharply peaked. In the case above, if we looked at only the 1D posteriors, we might be led to believe that the \"Galaxies\" and \"CMB\" posteriors were inconsistent with each other, while in 2D we can see that they overlap nicely.\n",
    "\n",
    "When there are interesting or relevant degeneracies, as in this case, best practice is to show them with a plot like the one above. The 1D CIs that we might put in a table could still be as described above, regardless of the degeneracy. Rarely, it might make sense to report a CI for a _combination_ of parameters that is well constrained by the data, e.g. corresponding to the short axis of one of the contours above. But, as this example shows, the relevant axis is rarely the same for different types of data that might constrain a model, and may not even be the same for different data sets of the same type. So this approach is of limited utility. For example, the short axis of the Galaxies constraints is approximately aligned with the long axis of the CMB constraints above. If we reported 1D CIs corresponding to that direction in parameter space, it would seem that Galaxies were much more constraining than the CMB (or vice versa), but this hardly provides a clear picture of how the two data sets complement one another, as the 2D plot does.\n",

    "Naturally, features like degeneracies can exist in more than 2 dimensions, but there isn't a widely used method for visualizing CR's in more than 2D. You may encounter color being used to show the most probable value of a third parameter at different points in the $\\theta_1$-$\\theta_2$ plane, but that's about it."

You might recognize them as approximately the integral of a Gaussian from $-1\\sigma$ to $+1\\sigma$ (68.3%) and $-2\\sigma$ to $+2\\sigma$ (95.4%), where $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation. Consequently, they are often referred to as \"$1\\sigma$ confidence\" and \"$2\\sigma$ confidence\". (This is another bit of terminology that we will almost certainly slip into, despite it not being technically meaningful.)\n",

Roughly speaking, you can just think of 68.3% as $2/3$ and 95.4% as $19/20$; conversely, there's a 1 in 3 chance that the 68.3% CR doesn't include the truth, but only a 1 in 20 chance that the 95.4% CR does not. Please note, though, that the difference between 95.0% and 95.4% is not necessarily quantitatively trivial; we aren't just being pedantic by including the third significant digit here.\n",
