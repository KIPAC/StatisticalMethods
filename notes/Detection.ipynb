    "* What does this mean? Increasing the prior ranges on the source position and flux makes any given point in parameter space less probable, making the detected model seem ever more contrived - and so this  will decrease the evidence for $H_1$, making the detection less significant (but only linearly, remember).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "* The frequentist procedure is to approximate the (maximum) likelihood ratio test statistic as being drawn from a $\\chi^2$ distribution with 3 degrees of freedom (the difference between the two models), and ask for the probability of getting a likelihood ratio larger than the observed value by chance, if in fact the source with the estimated flux is present. This calculation involves the same *notion of a distribution of replica datasets* as we saw in the posterior predictive model checks, but in frequentism only the sampling distribution is used (not the posterior PDF). This is because the only question being asked is *\"What's the probability of getting the data if the truth is exactly X?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Bayesian evidence ratio is more conservative, *because it takes into account the uncertainties on the source parameters*  - that were both present before the data were taken, and remain after they have been included.  However, it's *expensive to compute,* and *it depends on the prior assignment made.* We will see later that the Fermi group opted for the classical route because of this second factor. "
