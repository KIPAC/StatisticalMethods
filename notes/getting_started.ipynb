    "We will be using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) with [IPython](http://ipython.org/) extensively in this course. It would probably be best to have these things running on your local machine, if possible. The [Stanford Unix compute system](https://uit.stanford.edu/service/sharedcomputing) is also available to students, although we can't say how well Jupyter notebooks work remotely. An alternative, which we have not attempted at this writing, might be to import notebooks to [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) and work with them in the cloud. Suffice to say that if you have computing issues, we will figure them out somehow.\n",

    "## Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming you will be using a system that you have administrative access to, the first thing you will need is Python (versions >= 3). Note that the Python included as part of MacOS doesn't count - it is highly restricted due to being part of the OS, so you will want to install a separate copy if you are using a Mac.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fastest way to get up and running is with [Miniconda](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). This provides a user-specific installation, so there is no possibility of conflicts or permissions issues with the system you are working on. If you're tempted to go for full-blown Anaconda instead... please think twice. I haven't ever tried and can't help if something goes wrong, and have heard stories about things going wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have a Python installation, you can of course try to use it, installing any additional packages needed (below). We're not aware of any particular reason why the required packages should cause problems. That said, depending on what packages you're carrying around at what versions, it can happen. Falling back on a clean installation (or environment) is always an option.\n",
    "\n",
    "### If you are completely new to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "... then you have a steep learning curve ahead of you, even though there will be a lot of example code to learn from. We recommend checking out the Python [tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html). Everyone can no doubt also appreciate the documentation for the [Python standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html), [NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/) and [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/).\n",

    "## Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have Python and either the `conda` or `pip` package manager (which you almost certainly will for no additional effort), you should be able to install and run either JupyterLab or classic Jupyter Notebook (your choice) following [these instructions](https://jupyter.org/install.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Python packages\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need a number of python packages in this course. The shopping list is given in the [requirements.txt](../requirements.txt) file, which to the best of our knowledge reflects which packages are available through `conda` (which should be used preferentially) as opposed to `pip`. For example,\n",
