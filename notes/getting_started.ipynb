    "We will be using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) with [IPython](http://ipython.org/) extensively in this course. The simplest way to work with these is on [Google Colab](http://colab.research.google.com). If you prefer to work offline or on another system, I strongly recommend a separate python installation (or at least conda environment) for this course in order to avoid package conflicts (instructions below). All the class notebooks are tested on both Colab and on a clean conda installation before the term begins. If you ignore the above advice and end up with computing issues, you will find little sympathy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial notebooks can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XHFb-RKXuJ2-wvn4SVZmenhe5YIW4_Y1?usp=sharing). Every enrolled student will be given access to their own data folder on Google Drive, containing data files that are unique to them. Others can use the [\"public\" data folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WWJRCkrm-0OR02oJjG1xgSqsyIMYJ90A?usp=sharing). What to do with these files depends on whether you are working in Colab or not (see below)."

    "## Setting up Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "Colab is a cloud-based Jupyter-like environment for working with notebooks like those used in this class. Within Colab, you can directly access your data folder on Drive using code already present in the notebooks. This code assumes that your folder is accessible in `MyDrive/Physics267_data`, which you can arrange by using the \"Organize: Add shortcut\" functionality of Drive to create a shorcut to the data folder from your root Drive folder, and renaming that shortcut \"Physics267_data\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For those who are familiar with Jupyter but not Colab, a couple of things to know:\n",
    "* You have no permanant conda/pip environment, but each notebook instance has a semi-permanent state. After a period of inactivity, they will be deactivated, at which point re-opening them is like restarting the kernel in Jupyter.\n",
    "* Many standard packages are preinstalled, and others can be installed within notebooks via `!pip install <package>`. This code will already be present when needed in the notebooks, although you will need to uncomment it.\n",
    "* Whether Colab saves notebooks with or without outputs is a per-notebook setting that you can change.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shared nature of a cloud service and the need to reinstall packages after an instance has been restarted can be irritants, but Colab is a good option if you are not comfortable or able to manage packages on your own system. As of mid-August 2024, all the class notebooks were functional in Colab, althoug hthis could change in the future as they update various packages."

    "The fastest and recommended way to get up and running is with [Miniconda](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). This provides a user-specific installation, so there is no possibility of conflicts or permissions issues with the system you are working on. If you're tempted to go for full-blown Anaconda instead... please don't. Similarly, if your plan is to use an installation you already have (without creating a fresh environment), please don't. **Every single** package conflict or related issue we have encountered has been with a student who decided that they, uniquely, would be fine without a clean Miniconda installation. They were wrong."

You will need to add `conda-forge` to the default list of channels to get everything. Probably the simplest and most robust method is to use [this environment file](../environment.txt), which enumerates specific versions of all packages, and is functional for all notebooks in this class as of mid-August 2024.
