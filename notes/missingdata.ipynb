    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth breaking down what each of the things mentioned in the title of these notes means.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Missing information** just means something that we don't know. This might seem like a very silly thing to bring up so late in the course, since, from the very beginning, our models have been full of things we don't know. The simplest example of this is the true value of some quantity that we make a measurement of - we know the value of the measurement, but, unless the sampling distribution is a delta function, we'll never know the true value perfectly. These not-perfectly-known parameters tend to proliferate in hierarchical models, especially.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Missing data** is just what it sounds like: data that could have or should have been measured (in some sense) but haven't been. In other words, some of those true quantities in our model aren't going to be connected to measured (and therefore constant) data values. Usually, we mean that there exist measurements of these quantities for some sources in our data set, and not others. This too may seem like a strange thing to even mention, since it doesn't obviously pose a problem for inference. Nothing prevents us from constructing a posterior distribution and/or marginalizing over those untethered parameters in the usual way. In the \"worst case\", they would simply be unconstrained, and their posteriors would be identical to whatever the corresponding priors dictate. (In a hierarchical model - think about the galaxy luminosity function example - those prior distributions may yet be constrained by the data that _do_ exist, allowing us to learn something about the sources for which direct measurements do not exist.)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there can be issues if data are missing in such a way that the existing data set is somehow biased or not representative, yet we would like to draw unbiased inferences about a representative population. Now we have to deal with **selection effects** - in other words the _selection_ process by which potentially measurable quantities are or are not measured has an _effect_ on the data available to us. _This too_ many seem like it doesn't pose a new problem, if we have taken the lessons from the very beginning of the course to heart, namely that the model must account for everything that determines the data. And this is true. Yet this can be tricky enough that it's worth having some notes specifically on the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key messages for this lesson, of which 2-3 should not come as a surprise by now:\n",
    "1. In astronomy, it's very unlikely that our data set is perfectly complete.\n",
    "2. It's our job to know whether the incompleteness can be ignored for the purpose of our inference.\n",
    "3. If not, we need to model it appropriately and marginalize over our ignorance."

    "\n",
    "In astronomical surveys, you might hear the (historical) terms **Malmquist bias** and **Eddington bias**. These have specific meanings linked to the context where they were coined, though they are often misused to refer to selection effects more generally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Malmquist bias refers to the fact that flux-limited surveys have an effective *luminosity* limit for source detection that increases with distance (redshift). Thus, the sample of measured luminosities is not representative of the whole population, where population is defined as everything above some constant luminosity. The nifty [graphic](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bias2.png) below illustrates that the failure to detect sources in the shaded region leads to the mean luminosity of the available sources being larger than the mean of the complete, luminosity-limited sample.\n",

    "Eddington bias refers to the impact of noise or other scatter on a measured luminosity function, the number of sources in some population as a function of $L$. (Here we need to understand the estimation procedure - measured counts would be deterministically converted to a luminosity and then a histogram of luminosities, without invoking the Bayesian machinery that you are now expert with.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the true $n(L)$ is steeply decreasing, the number of apparently luminous sources will be boosted relative to the truth in the presence of scatter. This happens even if the scatter itself is symmetric, simply because there are more faint sources that might be scattered up than bright sources that might scatter down. The graphics below illustrate how random, symmetric shifts - representing a sampling distribution - yield a net increase in the number of sources that exceed some threshold in luminosity. This will happen for any threshold, so long as the luminosity function is decreasing for a while below it (i.e. while there's no lack of sources to be scattered up). In the case of these simulated points, you can see by eye that the luminosity function increases rapidly to a peak at $L\\sim1.5$ or $2$, and decreases rapidly thereafter.\n",

    "These are two particular manifestations of selection effects, which we can treat in a more general framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these astronomical terms, there is some related terminology that you might come across in relevant statistics literature: **censoring** and **truncation**. (These are not in one-to-one correspondence with Malmquist and Eddington bias.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Censoring means that a given data point (source) is known to exist, but a relevant measurement for it is not available. This could refer to the complete absence of a measurement, but usually this term shows up in the context of an \"upper limit\" placed on, e.g., the flux of a source that is independent known to exist. (Of course, the notion of an upper limit on a measurement doesn't really exist in Bayes' world, just as the \"error bar\" does not exist. A measurement _was_ made, so there is a fixed constant that we can call data, and all we need to properly interpret it is the form of the sampling distribution. This naturally doesn't stop people from reporting upper limits when they fail to detect something.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Truncation means that not only are measurements missing, but the total number of sources that *should* be in the data set (in the sense that they are the population we are trying to model) is unknown. In other words, the lack of a measurement means that we don't even know about a particular source's existence. Truncation is a natural feature of surveys that rely on remote sensing, which is to say all astronomical surveys, hence the fact that Malmquist and Eddington were worrying about it 100 years ago."

We normally don't think about the fact that swapping modeled sources (within a hierarchical class) is meaningless to us when mapping generative models to inferences. Yet, for a model without selection effects, there straightforwardly are $N!$ data sets that could be generated which are perfectly equivalent apart from exchanging data points. Of course, in the case of a complete data set, this $N!$ term would be a constant, and we would normally be justified in ignoring it anyway.

    "Keep in mind that this example is not fully general. In particular, we assumed that data were independent, so that the likelihood would factor into a product over clusters, and that the prior for $N$ was Poisson. These assumptions don't always apply, but they're not uncommon approximations either.\n",
    "\n",
    "One assumption that we made in the description and figures, but never once invoked in the derivation was that of a constant selection threshold in $\\hat{y}$. In fact, we didn't really have to assume anything about $P(I_k|\\ldots)$ except that it's independent of clusters _other than_ the $k$th one. It's slightly remarkable that the final likelihood is modified only to contain the expectation values of $N$ and $N_\\mathrm{det}$, and not to more directly reflect any details of the selection method.\n",

    "Specifically, the following:\n",
    "* For models that have the $x$-$y$ scaling approximately right, any detected points at the left end of the plot are going to be just above the detection limit. So their exact $\\hat{y}$ values don't actually tell us much at all.\n",
    "* _But_, the fact that there are just 3 around $x\\approx0$ (say) does tell us something. It tells us that the scatter about the line, combined with the total number of sources with $x\\approx0$, must be such that detecting 3, as opposed to 0 or 3000, is reasonable.\n",
    "* So, as long as we see enough detected sources to have some chance at estimating the scatter, and as long as our prior $p(x)$ is reasonably accurate and not too unconstrained, we should be ok. These sources are not going to \"pull\" the fitted line up at the left side of the plot - in fact, they will resist such a pull because those models would predict too many detections at small $\\hat{x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "And indeed, somewhat amazingly, it works. Granted, the need to model a hidden population places additional demands on our data, in terms of the size/quality of data set required to get a data-dominated (rather than prior-dominated) result. The need to model a hidden population also, naturally, demands that we have decent prior information about it, in the form of $p(x)$. This example is not one where we can try to marginalize over some \"uninformative\" or super-flexible function for $p(x)$ and expect reasonable results. (In particular, the steeply falling shape of the true $p(x)$ is not something that a typical \"uninformative\" hyperprior is likely to favor.) Such is the cost of doing business in a cruel and uncaring Universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, people have sometimes attempted to deal with selection effects simply by modifying the sampling distribution to be, e.g., a truncated Gaussian (truncated below the detection limit). This does reflect the first point above, that the lowest-$x$ sources will be barely detected. Yet the real information they provide, that they were detected at all, and in what numbers, isn't used. Consequently, the best fit for such a model (even if provided with exactly the right $p(x)$ and $N$) will still find a way to pass through those left-most detected points, rather than well below them."

There may be shortcuts when it comes to carrying out the inference, but not at the stage of setting it up conceptually.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, selection depended explicitly on one of our observables, so evidently the selection is not ignorable. On the other hand, clusters that are missing because they live in a part of the sky outside of our survey are clearly not missing for reasons related to either of our observables; that particular selection effect is ignorable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A less strict version of ignorability might be expressed as, \"Does ignoring selection effects bias me at a level I care about?\" Generating mock data and analyzing it lazily is the best way of answering this."

    "The particular modeling complexities discussed here are, conceptually, the most challenging I've had do deal with. It was a slog to think through to the solution to the example above, it was another slog to realize that the solution is actually very simple from the right perspective, and it remains a slog to try to explain it all. Yet the basic issue of selection effects, as described above, is absolutely central to cosmology and astrophysical population studies. Unsurprisingly, therefore, this is an area where ad-hoc approaches have proliferated and remain common. So, while you may not end up using any of the results here in practice, hopefully you'll keep in mind that even in this difficult terrain _there is a right way_ to do inference - and it follows from basic principles rather than being something that feels like it might kind of work."
