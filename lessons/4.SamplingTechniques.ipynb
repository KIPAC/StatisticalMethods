    "## About this session\n",
    "### Have you played with MCMC sampling before? If so, sit next to someone who hasn't!\n",
    "#### By now, you know that the main practical challenge of doing Bayesian inference is obtaining samples from the posterior distribution. Today's class is all about the nuts and bolts of sampling from probability distributions that, in general, we don't know very much about ahead of time. We'll start out by playing around with a case where we know the right answer analytically, namely the posterior from fitting a linear model to data with Gaussian uncertainites.\n",
