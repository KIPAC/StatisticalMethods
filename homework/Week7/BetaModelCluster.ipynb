    "1. **Make a copy** of this notebook in your clone of the [**private** course repository](https://github.com/abmantz/phys366_2019). Edit that copy, not the version in the public repository clone. Please *follow the instructions in the [private repo README](https://github.com/abmantz/phys366_2019/blob/master/README.md)* by locating your solutions on a path like `phys366_2019/HW_week<N>/<Your Name(s)>/` and note that *case matters*.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Remember that you will submit your solution by pull request to the **private** repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check again that your solutions are located on the correct path** (see 1). Failing to follow these simple instructions this creates more work for the person doing the grading, with predictable results.\n",

    "> By now, you should have identified what data you plan to use, obtained it, and played around a little. Prove it by submitting some kind of visualization of the data that you have generated yourselves, with a brief explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with your homework solution, push your (team's) visualization to your fork of the **private repo** in `phys366_2019/Project_milestones/<project name>/` and submit a PR to the **private** repository. As above, failing to take note of the correct path will incur wrath.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sending us feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've submitted your solution, don't forget to also fill out the very quick (and required!) **[weekly feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfH0JGjJd67ANAOcUiRT54nmYtQHViKyOQe-20cny3GDytV6Q/viewform?usp=sf_link).**\n"

Unlike previous assignments, here you are welcome and encouraged to use code packages from outside this class. The only restriction is that you must understand how the method works (at the level that we covered \"advanced\" methods in class), and your solution must use _different_ fitting code than we have used before. That means\n",
